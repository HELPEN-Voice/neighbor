While 21 neighbors hold low or unknown influence, the profile includes two high-influence entities—Arizona Public Service (APS) and the local HOA—and three medium-influence stakeholders. No opposition was identified, with four neighbors supporting the project and one remaining neutral, as most organizational entities are driven by financial interests and property values. The neighbor landscape is primarily composed of passive investors and residential interests, with no documented evidence of organized community resistance.",

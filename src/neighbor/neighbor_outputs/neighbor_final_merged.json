Likewise, none of these landowners hold any notable public office or leadership role, indicating no high-influence neighbors in the community. None of the five adjacent landowners have a documented public stance regarding the development, with all classified as \"unknown\" in the absence of any stated support or opposition. Their community influence appears limited — none hold public office or leadership roles, and only one family (the Stoeltings) has notable long-term local ties that might confer moderate social influence. Two neighboring landowners were identified: a local veterinarian couple and an absentee co-owner of a family-held parcel. Neither has a recorded public stance on development (0 support, 0 oppose, 2 unknown). One neighbor (the vet couple) holds medium community influence as local professionals, while the other (absent landowner) has low influence. The neighboring entities are long-established family farming corporations that hold significant acreage in Harlan County, NE. Murdoch Enterprises Inc. (led by the Murdoch family) and James Drake Farm Enterprises LLC (owned by the Drake family) are primarily engaged in corn and grain agriculture. Neither appears to be a commercial developer; their interests lie in farming, though the Murdochs’ local leadership role could translate into influence over any development proposals. Potential risks include these landowners opposing projects that threaten their land use or water resources, but conversely they could support or partner in developments that provide financial benefits without harming their farm operations.",

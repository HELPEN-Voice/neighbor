None hold formal public office or notable leadership roles, and community influence appears limited – only one household (a local contractor–realtor couple) shows moderate influence through business connections. All five neighbors maintain a low public profile with no known stances on development or clean energy projects. None holds an official position in Anderson County or has been visible in community debates, and all are considered low-influence in terms of community impact. All five profiled neighbors have an **unknown stance** (none have publicly stated support or opposition to the development). They are predominantly private landowners with **low** community influence; none hold public office or prominent leadership roles locally. All five profiled neighbors have no documented stance on local development or clean energy (5 unknown). None holds a public office or leadership role, indicating low individual influence across the board. They appear to be ordinary residents without significant community clout. All five profiled neighbors are private landowners with no documented public stance on the development. All are classified as low-influence residents, as none hold notable civic roles. Stances remain unknown, with none on record explicitly supporting or opposing the project. All three profiled neighbors have no documented stance on local development or clean energy. None hold notable public positions or leadership roles in Anderson County. All appear to be private landowners with limited community influence and would need direct outreach to gauge their views. Two neighboring landowners are locally-registered LLCs holding rural parcels in Anderson County. Neither appears to have public profiles or disclosed ownership beyond basic property records. One is a farm-oriented entity (Six O Ranch LLC) and the other a property investment entity (Oscar BP Properties LLC), with limited evidence of community involvement or stated positions on development. Both seem primarily concerned with their landholdings and have not been identified in public sources as major community influencers or vocal opponents/supporters of development.",

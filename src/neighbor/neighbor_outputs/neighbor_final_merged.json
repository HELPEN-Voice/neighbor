Among the three private residents profiled, none have documented positions on development (all noted stances are \"unknown\"). All individual neighbors appear to have limited community influence (no public offices or major civic roles), while the Village of Roxana itself is a high-influence stakeholder as the local government. All five neighbors have an **unknown** stance toward the development, as none have made public statements of support or opposition. Three neighbors (the Johnsons, Ms. Warren, and Ms. Niemeyer) hold **Medium** community influence through roles in education, local business or nonprofit leadership, while the other two have **Low** influence with minimal public profiles. All five profiled neighbors have no documented public stance on the proposed development (all classified as \"unknown\" stance). None holds an official role or exceptional influence in the community; all appear to have a low community profile. This suggests a low concentration of high-influence neighbors in the immediate area. None of the five profiled neighbors have a documented stance on development or clean energy, as no public statements or actions could be found. Most exhibit low community profiles, with only one (a retired school administrator) suggesting moderate local influence. No high-influence community figures were identified in this group. All three profiled neighbors have no documented stance for or against development, with each noted stance classified as unknown. None of these landowners holds a high-influence position in the community; they appear to be private residents without public leadership roles. Neighbors consist of major energy companies (WRB Refining – a Phillips 66/Cenovus joint venture, and Shell Oil), a regional fuel retailer (Midwest Petroleum), and local government bodies (Roxana school and park districts). The industrial neighbors are externally owned and wield significant economic resources, while the school and park districts rely on refinery property taxes and have banded together to protect their revenue (generally supporting growth that bolsters the tax base). None of these entities is a pure land speculator or direct competitor in energy development, but the refinery JV and Shell have the financial means to influence or oppose new projects if their operational interests or liability concerns are threatened. The adjacent organizations include a small private real estate holding LLC and a county government trustee. PRS Properties LLC appears to be a minor land investor with no public profile or known stance, likely interested only in property value. Madison County Trustee is a government entity holding a tax-delinquent parcel with no independent agenda, posing little risk of active opposition or support.",

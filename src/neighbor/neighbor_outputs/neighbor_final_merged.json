  "overview_summary": "None of the five neighbors have a documented stance on the development (0 support, 0 oppose, 5 unknown). One high-profile neighbor (a prominent conservation farmer) holds significant influence, while the others show medium to low community influence with limited public engagement. None of these four neighboring landowners have a documented stance on development (all noted stances are unknown). Most appear to have low public profiles in the community. Only one neighbor – a multi-parcel dairy farmer – shows moderate local influence. All profiled neighbors have an **unknown** stance on development (no explicit public position found). One is a high-influence local official (Rogers, a county supervisor), another is a medium-influence large-scale farmer (Schutz), and the rest appear to have low community influence. None of the five profiled neighbors have taken a documented public stance on local development or clean energy projects. All are classified as having an unknown position due to lack of explicit statements. Community influence appears limited – none are current officials or outspoken civic leaders, with any local sway coming mostly from their status as landowners rather than formal roles. Neither of the two profiled neighbors has made a public stance on the development, leaving both classified as \"unknown\" in their support or opposition. Both landowners appear to have limited formal roles or public engagement, meaning the cohort includes no high-influence community figures (both are low-influence local residents). Among the neighboring landowners, four are family trusts of local farmers indicating long-held agricultural properties, and one is a major agribusiness. The family trusts (Lentz, Wirth, Whitmore, Olson) represent private individuals with substantial farmland but no corporate structure, so their development stance is personal and not publicly documented. The sole corporate neighbor is Jennie-O Turkey Store Inc., a Hormel Foods subsidiary operating a large turkey processing plant; it has significant economic influence but has shown no overt position on outside developments. No competitors or known organized opposition groups were identified in this neighbor set, though the farming families may be motivated to preserve land value and rural character, and the corporation will prioritize protecting its operations. All three neighboring landowners are listed as living or family trusts, indicating individual or family farm ownership rather than corporate entities ([www.wispolitics.com](https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/western-wisconsin-conservation-council-farmer-to-farmer-conversations-shorten-path-to-conservation-success/#:~:text=Jerry%20Emmert%20and%20his%20brother%2C,farm%20in%20the%20late%201990s)). One trustee, Jerry Emmert, is a third-generation farmer known for conservation-oriented practices in western Wisconsin ([www.wispolitics.com](https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/western-wisconsin-conservation-council-farmer-to-farmer-conversations-shorten-path-to-conservation-success/#:~:text=Jerry%20Emmert%20and%20his%20brother%2C,farm%20in%20the%20late%201990s)) ([www.wispolitics.com](https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/western-wisconsin-conservation-council-farmer-to-farmer-conversations-shorten-path-to-conservation-success/#:~:text=Emmert%20has%20been%20integrating%20conservation,place%20and%20improving%20water%20quality)). The other trusts (Amundson and Wirth) have no notable public profile or documented stance on development; they likely view their land as a family asset and farmland to preserve ([abcdocz.com](https://abcdocz.com/doc/662118/wisconsin-farmers-union-news#:~:text=into%20the%20%E2%80%9CBig%20Tent,the%20good%20work%20of%20supporting)).",

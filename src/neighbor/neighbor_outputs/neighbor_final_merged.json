The \u201cMHP\u201d in its name denotes \u201cMobile Home Park.\u201d This LLC is part of a broader trend of outside investors acquiring manufactured home communities in New York; around 2016, a Schenectady-based fund (MHC Acquisition Fund III) was established to purchase such parks ([altamontenterprise.com](https://altamontenterprise.com/08222016/legal-notices-aug-11-2016#:~:text=Notice%20of%20Formation%20of%20a,Purpose%3A%20Any%20lawful%20purpose)). Although the specific owners of Ritchie Road MHP LLC are not publicly advertised, the involvement of a registered agent in Schenectady suggests an out-of-region investment group manages the park. Typically, these owners focus on maximizing rental income and property value, sometimes leading to rent increases that concern residents ([qa.time.com](https://qa.time.com/5464621/affordable-housing-mobile-homes/#:~:text=Residents%20Are%20Fighting%20to%20Protect,where%20private%20equity%20firms%20and)). In terms of development stance, the company itself has not made any public statements. Its interest lies in a stable environment for its tenants (who lease the land for their homes) and protecting its long-term revenue stream. A neighboring development could raise concerns for them if it threatens to disrupt the park (through construction noise, increased traffic on Ritchie Road, or other quality-of-life impacts for residents). Conversely, improvements to local infrastructure or utilities might be seen as a benefit. The residents of the mobile home park, while not the owners, represent a community that could voice support or opposition depending on how the project affects them. The LLC owner is likely mindful of resident relations to avoid vacancies, but ultimately their decisions are profit-driven.",

You might offer community benefits that indirectly help the park (e.g., road improvements or community investment) to get ownership\u2019s goodwill. For the residents, consider a community meeting or outreach to address their questions; their contentment will in turn reduce pressure on the owners to intervene. Ensure any feared impacts (like construction dust or drainage changes) are addressed in the plans and communicated. By proactively collaborating, you can turn a potential opponent into a neutral party or even a quiet supporter. Keep in mind the owners are primarily concerned with revenue \u2013 if the development doesn\u2019t threaten occupancy or costs, they are unlikely to object strenuously."

None hold notable sway in local affairs; each appears to have low community influence with no official roles. Their focus is likely on practical concerns like thorough environmental cleanup and safeguarding property values, given their long-term residence near the former industrial site. All three adjacent landowners have no recorded stance regarding the development. Two of the neighbors (the Town and a major company) wield high influence in the community, while the one private individual has low influence. The neighboring landowners are mostly industrial and utility organizations \u2013 a property investment LLC, a chemical distributor, a fuel terminal operator, the regional electric utility, and a construction firm. These entities primarily focus on their operations (fuel, chemicals, power) ([enviro.epa.gov](https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/P2_EF_Query.p2_report?ChemicalId=0000095636&DocCtrlNum=&FacilityId=14150CHMCN3709R&Opt=0&ReportingYear=2016#:~:text=TONAWANDA%2C%20NY%2014150%20Parent%20Company%3A,Trimethylbenzene)) ([dec.ny.gov](https://dec.ny.gov/news/environmental-notice-bulletin/2021-07-28/completed-application/sunoco-tonawanda-terminal#:~:text=renewal%20of%20its%20Title%20V,The%20facility%20is)) and have not led community opposition in the past. Their likely concerns are technical (safety, infrastructure access) rather than ideological, suggesting they would remain neutral or pragmatic about new development if their interests are protected. The neighboring landowners are a mix of corporate and investment entities \u2013 including a major local energy company\u2019s landholding arm, small private realty investors, a single-purpose industrial property LLC, and an out-of-town mobile home park owner. Most appear financially motivated rather than community-driven: one (NOCO) carries significant regional influence and resources, while the others are smaller players focused on property value and income. Potential opposition would likely stem from economic concerns (property value, competition) rather than ideological stances, though the larger company could muster notable political and legal power if provoked. The neighboring landowners are a mix of small private LLCs, a national real estate investor, and a government entity. Several appear to be holding land passively (for example, no active business or public profile) ([search.sunbiz.org](https://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResults?ListNameOrder=JOLIOLI+L190002155700&inquiryDirectionType=CurrentList&inquiryType=EntityName&searchNameOrder=JOLIOLI+L190002155700&searchTerm=Jolito%2C+Inc.#:~:text=and%20Trademarks%20by%20Name%20search,INACT%2FUA%20JOLI)) ([www.bizprofile.net](https://www.bizprofile.net/ny/tonawanda/67#:~:text=No%20,transport%20realty)), while one (EZ Industries LLC) is an operating local auto service business ([www.mapquest.com](https://www.mapquest.com/us/new-york/eric-one-stop-416874668#:~:text=EZ%20Tire%20Auto%20in%20North,great%20at%20an%20affordable%20rate)). One adjacent parcel is owned by Erie County itself, indicating a public stake (possibly for infrastructure or brownfield purposes) ([www3.erie.gov](https://www3.erie.gov/environment/land-development-economic-development-planning-studies#:~:text=Planning%20www3,Lee%20Design%20Professionals%20as%20the)). No clear evidence of organized opposition was found among these owners; their motivations likely range from profit and property value to public-interest considerations, posing varying levels of risk or opportunity for a new development.",

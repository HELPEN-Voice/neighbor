  "overview_summary": "Screening of 15 neighboring landowners—comprising 13 organizations and two individuals—reveals a landscape dominated by 11 high-influence entities, one medium-influence neighbor, and three with low or unknown influence. While eight neighbors support the project and three remain neutral, one organization holds an opposing stance due to potential conflicts with industrial property values, while three stances remain unknown. Key stakeholder interests center on the protection of water resources, grid infrastructure requirements, and the strategic alignment of new development with existing regional coal, energy, and economic development initiatives.",

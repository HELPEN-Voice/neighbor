  "overview_summary": "Of the 13 neighbors profiled, 10 are residents and 3 are organizations, primarily consisting of long-established dairy farming operations and family-owned agricultural trusts. While nine neighbors have unknown stances, four are identified as high-influence entities and two have expressed opposition, citing concerns over the loss of productive farmland and the preservation of rural legacies. Although some landowners may prioritize the financial security of land leasing, the prominence of large-scale agricultural interests presents a risk for organized resistance if the development is viewed as a threat to local farming heritage.",

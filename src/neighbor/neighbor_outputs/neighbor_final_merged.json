None hold any public office or formal community leadership, indicating influence remains low among these neighbors. All five neighboring landowners have no documented public stance on development proposals – none were found to have openly supported or opposed projects. They also appear to wield limited influence in the community, as none hold notable public offices or leadership roles based on available records. All five profiled neighbors have an undetermined stance on the proposed development, as none have made public statements supporting or opposing such projects. Likewise, none are high-profile community figures – all appear to have low influence locally, with no current officeholders or prominent leaders among them. All five profiled neighbors have no clearly documented position on the development (5 unknown stances). None are public officials or prominent civic leaders; all appear to wield low community influence, with no high-influence neighbors identified. All five profiled neighbors have no clearly documented stance (support or opposition) toward the development, so their positions remain unknown. None hold high-profile community roles or offices; all appear to be private residents with low individual influence in local affairs. All three profiled neighbors have no recorded stance on local development or clean energy proposals, with each classified as 'unknown' in noted stance. None appear to wield significant community influence – no high-profile roles or major landholdings were identified among these neighbors, and all are rated low in local influence. The adjacent landowners include a major brownfield redeveloper and a utility company. Brayton Point LLC, owned by St. Louis-based Commercial Development Co., controls the former power plant site and has aggressively pursued industrial/offshore wind reuse (while clashing with local officials over interim scrap operations). New England Power Co., a National Grid utility subsidiary, holds transmission infrastructure in the area; it is influential in regional power supply but generally neutral on land development, focusing instead on protecting and utilizing its grid assets for projects like offshore wind.",

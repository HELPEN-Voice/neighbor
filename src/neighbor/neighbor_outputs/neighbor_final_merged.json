Four of the five are high-influence stakeholders (major corporations or government bodies), with the remaining one being a moderately influential private landowner. The neighboring landowners are predominantly agricultural entities, plus one industrial operator. Most (Flattop Ranch, Huem Headwaters, Dimock Farms) are working ranch or farm operations with long local ties and a focus on water and livestock. One (CSH Properties LLP) appears to be a passive landholding partnership with little public presence. The final neighbor, GCC Trident LLC, is an industrial cement plant owner engaged in renewable energy, likely neutral or supportive toward development, whereas the ranching neighbors could be cautious about any project impacting water or grazing. The identified neighboring entity is a privately held LLC with little to no public profile or disclosed ownership. It appears to function as a passive landholding in Broadwater County, MT, with unclear motivations beyond preserving or enhancing its property’s value. This type of silent land investor could potentially be swayed by financial incentives but otherwise lacks evident community influence or development stance.",

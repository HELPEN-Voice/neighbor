  "overview_summary": "None of these five adjacent landowners has a documented public stance on development or clean energy at this time. One neighbor (Michael and Tambra Bain) holds multiple parcels and is a notable landowner, while the others have limited public profiles. Influence levels skew low, with only one medium-influence landowner and no clear high-influence community leaders among them. None of the five neighboring owners have a documented public stance on the proposed development (0 support, 0 oppose, 5 unknown). One couple (the Schofields) stands out with high community influence as a longtime local pastor and family, while the other neighbors have low public profiles and minimal evident influence. None of the five profiled neighboring landowners have a noted public stance on the proposed development or clean energy (all are classified as 'unknown' stance). Their community influence is uniformly low, with no high-profile local figures identified among these neighbors. All five neighboring landowners are private residents with no clear public stance on development, and none appear to hold prominent civic positions. All are likely low-profile community members, with no documented support or opposition to projects, indicating mostly unknown stances and generally low individual influence in local affairs. All neighboring individuals have an undetermined stance on the proposed development, with no clear public positions for or against it. None hold notable leadership roles; most appear to be private landowners with low public profiles. Consequently, all four profiled neighbors are of low community influence, suggesting that outreach should be personalized and informative. Of the two neighboring landowners reviewed in Flat Rock, Jackson County, none have a documented public stance either supporting or opposing new development projects. Both individuals also appear to have relatively low influence locally, with no evidence of official roles or prominent community leadership. Neighboring landowners include a major family-run cattle operation and a private family trust. Lake Majestik LLC (Cornelison family) is a large-scale ranch and employer known for land stewardship, likely to prioritize preserving agricultural land. The Pilote Family Trust represents individual landowners with no public profile or clear stance on development.",

While most neighbors have low influence, four high-influence figures were identified, including one individual (Skirvin) who actively opposes the project and three medium-influence professionals. Two neighbors support the development, notably the Mann family, who manage 2,000 acres of farmland and have previously explored hosting solar infrastructure. The remaining community consists primarily of multi-generational farming entities and local professionals whose positions may be influenced by agricultural preservation and economic incentives.",

No outspoken supporters or opponents were identified among them, and high-influence community figures are absent in this group. None of the five nearby landowners have a clear public stance on the proposed development, as no explicit support or opposition has been documented. Their community influence appears limited – none hold public office or prominent civic roles – although one couple owns substantial land which could confer some local sway. None of these five neighbors has taken a public stance for or against the development, so their positions remain unknown. Four are private residents with low community influence, while one (Thorburn) carries moderate influence due to longstanding local roots and landownership. None of these five adjacent landowners has taken a public position for or against the proposed development, so all are categorized with an unknown stance. Their community influence is limited – none hold prominent local roles, and all appear to be relatively new residents with modest public profiles. All five neighboring landowners have no clearly documented stance on the proposed development, as none were found to have made public comments or taken positions in local forums. Their influence in the community appears low, with no high-profile roles or notable community leadership among them. This suggests outreach will need to be personalized since none are established community influencers or vocal development critics. The neighboring landowners include a private family trust (individual trustees), a large community church, the state’s primary electric utility, a local homebuilding LLC, and an out-of-area development LLC.

Potential opposition funding or activism would most likely come from the profit-driven landholders (the homebuilder and the outside developer) if they perceive new development as harming their property values ([www.essexcca.com](https://www.essexcca.com/industrial-solar-farms#:~:text=Alliance%20www,As%20noted%20in%20the)), whereas the church and utility are less inclined to openly oppose projects.",

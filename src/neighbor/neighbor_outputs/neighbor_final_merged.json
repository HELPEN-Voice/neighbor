Three neighboring landowning parties were identified, and none have a documented stance on development (all are noted as unknown). One neighbor is a high-profile community member due to an elected park board position, while the other two have low public profiles or influence. Land ownership around the Rochelle project site is split between a solar development LLC backed by a national renewable energy investor and several private landholding entities (family trust, bank trustee, land trust, and family partnership). The developer (Rochelle Solar LLC) is an outside party pushing for a solar farm, whereas the other owners represent long-time local farmland interests who generally value agricultural use. These local landowners tend to keep a low profile publicly, but they collectively hold substantial acreage and could influence community sentiment against new development perceived to threaten farmland. Most neighboring parcels are held by non-local corporate or institutional owners – including a national insurance corporation and a farmland investment fund – indicating primarily absentee land investment motivations [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/environment/ct-illinois-farmland-ownership-corporate-climate-justice-20230827-e5bpml5y3vdyfbipwjxhv5ukvi-story.html) [Farm Progress](https://www.farmprogress.com/farm-business/who-owns-the-most-farmland-in-illinois-). The City of Rochelle is the one public, local stakeholder, likely supportive of development if it aligns with economic growth plans [City of Rochelle](https://www.excelinrochelle.com/content/business-environment/rochelle-dashboard.html). None of the private LLC or trust owners appear to have an active community presence, suggesting their stance will hinge on financial impact rather than local sentiment [Farm Progress](https://www.farmprogress.com/farm-business/who-owns-the-most-farmland-in-illinois-). Overall, the landscape features absentee investors focused on land value, and a municipal government focused on planned growth, which may present opportunities for negotiation and alignment rather than grassroots opposition. The neighboring landowners include the county government, a private LLC with local farming ties, a bank-operated land trust concealing its beneficiary, and a small charitable foundation. None are commercial developers; instead they represent local governance, passive land investments, and philanthropic ownership. Potential opposition would likely stem from farmland preservation interests or individual financial motives rather than any direct competitive development.",

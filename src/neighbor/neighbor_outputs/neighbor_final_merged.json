  "overview_summary": "For all five profiled neighbors, no clear public stance on development or clean energy could be identified (0 support, 0 oppose, 5 unknown). Only one neighbor – an influential former local official – stands out with high community influence; the rest appear to have low profiles and minimal sway in local affairs. None of the five profiled neighbors have a clearly documented stance regarding development or clean energy – in fact, 0 are on record supporting or opposing the project, with all five classified as \"unknown\" in stance. Their community influence also appears limited; none hold high-profile positions locally, and most have no public civic roles or leadership credentials, suggesting they are low-influence neighbors overall. All five adjacent landowners have no publicly documented stance on development or clean energy – none have made clear statements of support or opposition. Most lack formal community roles; only one (Tillapaugh) is part of a prominent multi-generation farm family, indicating some community influence, while the rest appear to have low public profiles. None of these five neighboring landowners have a documented stance for or against development, as no public statements or actions could be found. Most appear to be low-profile residents with no formal community roles; one was a local business owner but is now deceased. Influence in the community is limited across the group, with all but one rated low and no high-influence neighbors identified. All five neighbors have an undetermined stance, with none having made public statements for or against the development. Likewise, none are high-profile community figures; most keep low profiles as private landowners (one was a town historian in the past), so overall community influence is low. All four profiled neighbors are private residents with no documented stance on local development (each is classified as \"unknown\" stance). None hold any public office or prominent community role; influence levels are low across the board with no high-influence neighbors identified. Rock District Solar LLC appears to be a special-purpose entity backed by Greenbacker Renewable Energy, aimed at constructing a 20 MW solar farm in Schoharie County. This profile suggests a commercial renewable energy developer (not a local resident or grassroots group). As a neighbor, they are likely focused on advancing their state-permitted solar project; they could potentially align with other renewable initiatives, but might also compete for grid connection capacity or similar resources.",

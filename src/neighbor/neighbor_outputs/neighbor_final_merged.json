  "overview_summary": "Among these five neighbors, none have been vocal public supporters of development or clean energy projects. One landowner (Flach) has signaled opposition to town-led land use changes, while the rest have no documented stance. Influence in the community is generally low, with only one being a major landowner with local name recognition. All five profiled neighbors have no clear public stance on local development, with each classified as \"unknown\" in terms of support or opposition. None of these landowners hold prominent community positions or notable influence; all are considered to have low individual impact in the area. None of the five Selkirk neighbors have an openly documented stance on development, with all classified as \"unknown\" in the absence of public statements. Community influence among these neighbors is low overall; none hold prominent official roles, indicating limited direct sway in local affairs. None of these four Selkirk neighbors has a documented public stance for or against local development projects. All remain low-profile residents without notable positions of civic influence, as none hold public office or lead community initiatives. The neighboring parcels are held by a mix of corporate, non-profit, and public entities. Two large industrial companies (Holcim and Callanan) own extensive tracts, indicating significant resources and political connections that could influence local development. A local church (Mount Moriah Ministries) and a small apartment-holding LLC (Ledgerock Apartments) are also present, neither of which shows public involvement in development debates. Lastly, the Albany County Land Bank, a quasi-governmental body, holds a parcel with the aim of returning it to productive use, likely aligning with revitalization efforts. Overall this ranges from highly influential corporate landowners who prioritize operational freedom, to community-oriented and public entities more inclined to support constructive development. Adjacent landowners include a conservation nonprofit, a major utility, a new speculative LLC, and a public school district. The Wetland Trust (environmental land trust) may resist development impacting wetlands. Niagara Mohawk (National Grid’s utility) controls critical grid infrastructure and is likely neutral or supportive if the project aligns with infrastructure needs. Core Four Group LLC appears to be a recently formed land investment with undisclosed backers, potentially looking to profit or develop, which could pose an unpredictable factor. The RCS school district, as a key local institution, will focus on tax revenue benefits and safety considerations for students, and is unlikely to actively oppose if those interests are addressed.",

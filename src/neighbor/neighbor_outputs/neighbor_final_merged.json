  "overview_summary": "All five profiled neighbors are private landowners in Flat Rock with no clear public stance for or against local development. None of them hold any known official positions or leadership roles in the community, indicating a low overall influence profile among these neighbors. None of the five neighboring landowners have made any public statements about the proposed development, so all are classified with an unknown stance. A couple of the neighbors (the Worley/Peet family) hold a large poultry farming operation, giving them moderate economic influence locally, but overall these individuals do not occupy official positions and have a low public profile in the community. None of the five profiled neighbors have a documented stance for or against new development, so their positions remain unknown. Four appear to have low community influence as private citizens without public roles, while one family’s large farming operation suggests a moderate economic influence locally. All five profiled neighbors are private landowners in rural Flat Rock with no publicly documented stances on development. Most have a low public profile and no evident community leadership roles. One neighbor appears to be a major poultry farmer, indicating a potentially higher local influence, but overall stances remain undisclosed. All four neighboring households have no documented stance on the development (all noted as unknown). None of these individuals appear to hold influential public roles locally, indicating a generally low community influence across the neighbor group. Both identified neighbors are landowning residents in Flat Rock with no recorded public stance on the development. Neither has been noted taking a clear support or opposition position. One neighbor (a major poultry farm operator) carries moderate local influence due to their economic presence, while the other is a low-profile landowner with limited public involvement. One neighboring landowner is Lake Majestik LLC, a family-run cattle ranch whose owners have a strong land conservation focus and moderate community influence, potentially cautious toward major development. Another neighboring parcel is held by the Pilote Family Trust (Pierre and Angela Pilote), a private holding with no public business presence and an unknown stance. Neither appears to be a corporate developer or speculator; however, the ranch family’s preservationist values suggest possible resistance unless the project aligns with protecting their agricultural land.",

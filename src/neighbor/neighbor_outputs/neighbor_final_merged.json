  "overview_summary": "There are five adjacent landowners, but only one is an individual resident; the remaining four are corporate or government property owners. The resident neighbor has been openly supportive of development, and none of the other owners have a publicly stated stance. Community influence is centered on the lone resident neighbor (a neighborhood activist), whereas the institutional owners have unclear local influence. None of the identified neighboring individual landowners have a documented stance on local development, as no public comments or records were found. All four residents appear to have low community influence, with no formal civic roles or notable public presence among them. One adjacent industrial landowner is a major company (handled separately), suggesting the only high-influence neighbor lies outside the individual resident profiles. All five neighboring landowners have no recorded positions for or against the project. Most exhibit low community influence (no official roles or public advocacy noted), with only one neighbor’s influence bolstered by a prominent local family background. Both identified neighbors have an **unknown** stance on the development due to no public statements found, and neither holds a notable influence in the community. In total, 0 neighbors show support, 0 oppose, and 2 are unknown; none are high-profile local figures. The adjacent landowners include a global chemical company, a public development agency, a freight railroad, and two private investment holders. None are grassroots community groups; their interests are largely economic or operational. Chemours (DuPont’s successor) and CSX are focused on managing legacy operations (environmental cleanup and rail service, respectively) rather than intervening in new projects. The Niagara County IDA is pro-development and likely an ally if the project promises jobs or investment. The LLC owners (2747 Buffalo Ave LLC and Elm Holdings Inc) appear to be speculators with no public stance, primarily interested in property value appreciation. Among the neighboring landowners, two are major energy entities (Niagara Mohawk Power Corp and the NY Power Authority) with significant influence and generally pro-development orientations. Another neighbor is a long-standing local nonprofit (Northpointe Council) focused on health services, which is unlikely to engage in land use disputes. The remaining owners include a private holding company (Elm Holdings Inc.) with undisclosed principals likely holding land as an investment, and a small event-center business (VT Event Centre LLC) with a low public profile; both appear unlikely to mount organized opposition. The adjacent landowners include a municipal government, a local church, and a private holding LLC – each with different interests and influence. The City of Niagara Falls (NY) is actively pursuing redevelopment and generally supportive of projects that boost the tax base ([www.developniagarafalls.com](https://www.developniagarafalls.com/#:~:text=The%20Development%20Opportunity)). New Hope Baptist Church is a small community congregation focused on worship, with no public record of engaging in development disputes ([cityofniagarafalls.prosgar.com](https://cityofniagarafalls.prosgar.com/CustomContent/Disclaimer#:~:text=The%20information%20contained%20herein%2C%20including,or%20implied%2C%20of%20information%20provided)). Sandstone Springs Holdings LLC appears to be a speculative landowner with anonymous backing, interested mainly in property value and without a visible community role ([cityofniagarafalls.prosgar.com](https://cityofniagarafalls.prosgar.com/CustomContent/Disclaimer#:~:text=The%20information%20contained%20herein%2C%20including,or%20implied%2C%20of%20information%20provided)). This mix suggests the City wields high decision-making power, while the church and LLC have lower profiles and would likely influence a project only if their specific interests are directly affected.",

Two come from longstanding local farm families that carry significant social capital in Dorchester County, whereas the others appear to have relatively lower public profiles or community influence. All profiled neighbors have no documented public stance regarding the development, with 0 openly supporting or opposing it. One neighbor holds a high-impact position (the long-serving county sheriff), while the others appear to have low community influence due to limited public roles. All five neighboring landowners have no documented public stance on development or clean energy, so their positions remain unknown. None holds any official local government role or overt community leadership; overall their influence in the community appears to be low. None of the four profiled neighbors has made a public statement supporting or opposing the Linkwood area development, so all are currently classified with unknown stances. Their community influence appears limited, as none hold public office or prominent leadership roles locally. Most are private landowners with minimal public profiles, indicating that any concerns or opposition they might have would likely remain low-profile and individual. None of the five adjacent landowners has a publicly documented stance either supporting or opposing the project. Most maintain a low profile in the community, with one notable exception: a long-established farming family patriarch who carries moderate influence due to his family’s generations of local farming. Two local individual landowners were identified, neither of whom has a publicly documented stance on development. Both appear to have limited public profiles, and no direct evidence of support or opposition was found. Community influence among these neighbors is generally low, with one having some familial ties to local civic circles. Concerns common in the area include preserving farmland and home values, reflecting issues raised by other nearby residents. The adjacent landowners around Linkwood WMA include private LLCs tied to local farming interests and the county government. Two family-linked LLCs (Harpers Legacy LLC and Edmondson Agriculture LLC) own nearby farmlands, while Dorchester County owns a parcel as public land. These entities likely prioritize land value, agricultural use, and community considerations in evaluating new development. None appear to be large corporations; their influence stems more from land ownership and local ties than organized development activity, though the county government wields regulatory power.",

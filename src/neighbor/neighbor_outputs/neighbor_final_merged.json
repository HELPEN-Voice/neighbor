While 10 neighbors have low influence, three individuals possess high influence, including a bank executive and the Oates family, who are noted for their civic leadership. The identified organization is a profit-driven LLC focused on commercial conversion, while the residential majority consists of private landowners in the Potomac District whose concerns likely center on rural preservation. No formal opposition has been documented among the five high- and medium-influence neighbors, but their prominent roles suggest they are key stakeholders for initial outreach.",

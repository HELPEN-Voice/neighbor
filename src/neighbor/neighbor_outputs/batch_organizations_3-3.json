The business registered \u201cLone Pine Dairy\u201d as an assumed business name in 1999 with the Idaho Secretary of State [B2BHint](https://b2bhint.com/en/company/us-id/lone-pine-dairy--82993). The company operated a 104-acre dairy facility in Canyon County with approximately 2,170 head of cattle (CAFO) and extensive on-site infrastructure [Homes.com](https://www.homes.com/property/5592-w-kuna-rd-kuna-id/yc655hgrg7xj7/). That dairy property was listed at $3.25 million and sold in May 2025, though the owners retained their Darigold milk shipping rights, suggesting an intent to continue dairy operations elsewhere [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/ID/Kuna/5592-W-Kuna-Rd-83634/home/117406212) [Homes.com](https://www.homes.com/property/5592-w-kuna-rd-kuna-id/yc655hgrg7xj7/). No public filings disclose the individual members or managers of the LLC (beneficial ownership remains unknown) [B2BHint](https://b2bhint.com/en/company/us-id/lone-pine-dairy--82993).",

  "overview_summary": "The organization identified is a long-standing dairy farming LLC that has been a major agricultural landowner in the area. It operated a 2,170-head dairy on roughly 100 acres and appears to be a family-run enterprise. The company recently sold its main farm in Canyon County, suggesting the owners may be repositioning or exiting, and their motivations likely center on farmland value and future agricultural use. No obvious ties to external developers or activist groups were found, indicating its interests lie primarily in farming and land preservation.",

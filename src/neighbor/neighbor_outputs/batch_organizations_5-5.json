The trust is not registered as a corporation or LLC in Kansas, meaning its beneficiaries (presumably the Forsberg family members) are not publicly listed in state business filings [Kansas Secretary of State \u2013 Business Entity Search](https://www.kansas.gov/bess). There are no news reports or public disclosures linking Forsberg Farm Trust to any development projects or community initiatives, indicating it functions solely as a landholding vehicle with a very limited public profile.",

Forsberg Farm Trust primarily serves as a landholding entity for agricultural property, with little publicly available information on its ownership beyond the family name. This suggests any stance on development would be driven by personal farmland interests rather than organized community influence.",

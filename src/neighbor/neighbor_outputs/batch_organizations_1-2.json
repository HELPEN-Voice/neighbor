These entities appear driven by financial and land-use interests rather than community activism. The timberland owner holds extensive forest acreage and may view development as an eventual exit strategy (similar to another local timber company that endorsed selling land for the solar project) [Virginia Mercury](https://virginiamercury.com/2019/02/25/virginias-biggest-proposed-solar-project-is-also-among-the-most-contentious-local-land-use-fights/). The telecom neighbor (part of American Tower Corp.) passively leases a cell tower site and is unlikely to engage in local development debates [GovTribe](https://govtribe.com/vendors/gtp-acquisition-partners-ii-llc-g-t-p-4kl25). Overall, these organizational neighbors do not exhibit strong community-facing stances; their focus is on asset value and operational continuity, suggesting opportunities to address their interests through financial or technical assurances rather than political concessions.",

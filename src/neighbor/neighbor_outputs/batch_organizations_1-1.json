Members of the Gilkey family collectively rank among the top farm subsidy recipients in Caldwell County \u2013 for example, Trevor Gilkey has received over $2 million in commodity subsidies since 1995, with other family members (Christie and Donnie Gilkey) receiving nearly $1 million each [EWG Farm Subsidy Database](https://farm.ewg.org/addrsearch.php?zip=42445). This indicates extensive row-crop farming operations and significant acreage under cultivation in the county. The family maintains a large farming operation (noted in pea and bean production) and has a vested interest in local agricultural land use [Manta](https://www.manta.com/c/mm2p73x/gilkey-farm-inc). A principal of the family, Ronald Gilkey, even received a $20,600 Paycheck Protection Program loan in 2020 to cover farm payroll, underscoring the farm\u2019s economic footprint and the family\u2019s engagement with federal programs [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/ronald-gilkey-9422258802).

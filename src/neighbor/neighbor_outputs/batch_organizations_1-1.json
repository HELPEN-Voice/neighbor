The Mann family controls about 2,000 acres and even explored hosting a large solar farm on their land, indicating a willingness to partner on development. In contrast, other neighbors like the Buis family\u2019s LLC have not publicly stated a stance; as multi-generational farmers, they may prioritize preserving farmland unless offered compelling incentives. Overall, these landowners carry weight in the community through their acreage and could either support or oppose new projects based on how those projects align with their agricultural interests.",

**Establishing Research Parameters**

I am initiating a detailed verification process for three key community stakeholders in Genesee County to understand their roles in the local energy landscape. By focusing on individuals in the Oakfield area, I plan to synthesize data regarding their professional influence, property interests, and public positions to ensure the most accurate profile of the project's neighborhood context.

---

## Thought 2



**Identifying Informational Gaps**

I have identified the need to clarify specific family ties and historical land ownership to ensure that the individuals mentioned in local records align correctly with the current project area. I am particularly focused on distinguishing between historical farm legacies and active community voices to resolve any potential ambiguities in their reported stances on development.

---

## Thought 3

While initial broad sweeps for the names mentioned returned various individuals across the country, including public figures and obituaries in distant states, I have identified specific land parcel identifiers that will act as more precise anchors for my investigation. I am focusing on differentiating the specific residents of Genesee County from these unrelated names to ensure the research remains grounded in the correct geographic context.

---

## Thought 5



**Resolving Data Conflicts**

I have observed potential discrepancies in existing references regarding whether these individuals hold local public office. My synthesis suggests that generic citations to town official lists may not be sufficient, so I am digging deeper to verify these claims and confirm the exact nature of their involvement in the Oakfield community, particularly concerning longstanding farming lineages and land ownership.

---

## Thought 6



**Targeting Property Records**

I am moving toward a more granular verification process by cross-referencing the specific property identification numbers with local municipal records. My next phase will involve looking for direct links between these land tracts and the individuals in question to confirm residency and ownership status, while also scanning local directories to resolve any remaining ambiguity about their identities.

---

## Thought 7



**Validating Property Interests**

I have successfully linked one of the individuals to specific land records in the Elba and Oakfield regions, confirming their status as a local property owner and clarifying that they do not hold a formal seat on the town board. Furthermore, I have connected the broader geographic area to a significant renewable energy development, which serves as a critical backdrop for the community context I am analyzing.

---

## Thought 8



**Reconciling Ownership Records**

I am currently resolving discrepancies between general identity searches and specific land registry data. My analysis indicates that common names are producing noise in the results, so I am refining my focus to cross-reference designated parcel identification numbers with county tax records to ensure accurate ownership attribution for the remaining stakeholders.

---

## Thought 9



**Investigating Community Stances**

Moving forward, I will be isolating specific land identifiers to confirm ownership and investigating public records for any recorded positions these individuals may have taken. By examining documentation related to regional energy projects, I aim to uncover whether these stakeholders have expressed specific sentiments or engaged in public discourse regarding local infrastructure changes.

I have successfully linked several residents to specific land parcels by synthesizing regional agricultural records and project-specific mapping data. Through this process, I identified a clear connection between one individual and the project footprint, which provides a stronger basis for understanding their likely perspective on the development. I also uncovered family context that roots these individuals in the local farming community, allowing me to build a more nuanced profile of their historical and current influence in the area.

---

## Thought 11



**Resolving Property Conflicts**

A significant contradiction has emerged regarding the current ownership of a key land tract. While initial information associated the parcel with one long-standing family, recent land-use applications suggest a different individual may now be managing or owning that property. I am also working through a potential identity overlap to ensure that historical records and recent community mentions are correctly attributed to the adult landowner rather than a younger relative with the same name.

---

## Thought 12



**Verifying Project Participation**

My next focus is to reconcile these property discrepancies by cross-referencing recent tax and permit records. I intend to determine if these individuals have entered into formal agreements like leases or easements, which would definitively clarify their stance on the regional energy initiative. I will also be looking for any specific public testimonies or board meeting records that might reveal direct statements regarding their support or concerns.

---

## Thought 13



**Detecting Project Participation**

I have synthesized information suggesting one of the primary stakeholders is likely a participating landowner in the regional energy project. By analyzing site-specific surveys and tax documentation, I’ve found that their property is integrated into the project’s footprint, indicating a formal interest in the development's success. This allows me to more accurately characterize their role within the community discourse and identify their likely stance on local infrastructure.

---

## Thought 14



**Uncovering Data Contradictions**

I am currently resolving a significant contradiction regarding the ownership of a specific land tract. While earlier references suggested one individual held the parcel, recent permit filings and local business activity point to a different owner who has been actively managing the site for the past few years. This finding challenges previous assumptions and highlights the need to differentiate between historical family legacies and the current individuals exercising control over the land.

---

## Thought 15



**Mapping Future Verifications**

To move forward, I will focus on investigating alternative property records and community archives to clarify the standing of the individual whose ownership status is disputed. I intend to look for definitive links between these residents and the energy project's contractual framework to confirm whether their involvement is as a primary lessor or a resident stakeholder, ensuring the final profile reflects their actual influence in the region.

---

## Thought 16

By synthesizing recent project documentation and parcel lists, I can now confirm that this individual has a contractual commitment to the development, which clarifies their position as a supportive landowner within the project footprint.

---

## Thought 17



**Resolving Ownership Discrepancies**

I am currently resolving a conflict between historical family associations and recent municipal records regarding a specific land tract. While local narratives link a long-standing farming family to certain acreage, official meeting minutes suggest a different individual may currently hold the title. I am thinking through these genealogical and property records to determine if the resident is a direct landowner or if their connection to the area is based on residency and family heritage rather than legal ownership.

---

## Thought 18



**Finalizing Stakeholder Context**

My next steps involve a targeted synthesis of land agreement summaries to determine if the remaining individuals are formal partners in the initiative or non-participating neighbors. I will be looking for specific mentions of their names in project-wide land summaries and cross-referencing family records to ensure that my final assessment accurately reflects their legal and community standing in relation to the development area.

---

## Thought 19



**Confirming Stakeholder Support**

I have successfully confirmed that one of the individuals in question has a formal lease agreement with the regional energy project, which establishes their stance as a supporter of the development. Additionally, I have refined the profile of another resident by distinguishing them from individuals with identical names in other parts of the state, clarifying that they are not currently listed as a primary participant in this specific project's agreements.

---

## Thought 20



**Investigating Familial Property Ties**

I am currently resolving a contradiction regarding a specific land parcel where the resident's name does not match the individual listed on recent permit applications. I am thinking through whether this stakeholder's connection to the land is maintained through a family trust or inheritance, as the property appears linked to a long-standing local farming lineage under a different primary name.

---

## Thought 21



**Tracing Local Lineage**

My next step involves synthesizing information from local archives and public notices to establish a definitive link between these individuals and the properties they are associated with. I plan to analyze family records and look for evidence of trust-based ownership to determine if the resident is an active participant in the community’s land-use decisions or a secondary stakeholder in the project area.

---

## Thought 22



**Differentiating Local Sentiment**

I have expanded my analysis of the community by confirming the specific positions of two additional landholders. While one is now verified as a project supporter through a formal agreement, I have determined that another maintains a neutral or private stance with no documented public involvement. This allows for a more granular understanding of the neighborhood landscape by distinguishing between active participants and neutral property owners.

---

## Thought 23



**Identifying Site Discrepancies**

I have encountered a significant mismatch between the residential data and the land records for one specific stakeholder. Finding a different address for this individual introduces a new layer of complexity, as I am now thinking through whether they have multiple property interests or if the previously associated land records were incorrectly attributed. Resolving this contradiction is essential for ensuring the accuracy of the regional context I am building.

---

## Thought 24



**Synthesizing Final Property Data**

To resolve these remaining questions, I am moving to cross-reference the newly found residential address with official county archives. This will allow me to clarify the ownership status for this final individual and provide a comprehensive overview of how each resident’s interests intersect with the regional infrastructure development, concluding the verification phase for these key figures.

---

## Thought 25



**Confirming Resident Commitments**

I have successfully verified the participation of another local stakeholder, confirming their support for the development through a formal land agreement. By synthesizing property records and project-specific documentation, I am now able to accurately place their interests within the broader neighborhood context and clarify their role in the community's energy landscape.

---

## Thought 26



**Untangling Property Discrepancies**

I am currently resolving a complex contradiction regarding a specific land identifier that is associated with two different physical addresses in recent records. While historical data links the property to a long-standing local family, more recent permit applications for the same parcel number list a different resident at a separate location. I am thinking through whether this indicates a recent land division, a change in ownership, or a clerical overlap in municipal filings.

---

## Thought 27



**Analyzing Map Records**

To move forward, I will focus on reconciling these conflicting address records by examining regional land-use archives and detailed map data. My goal is to determine the current legal owner of the disputed tract and investigate the standing of the farming family associated with it to better understand their historical influence and current perspective on the project.

---

## Thought 28

**Resolving Identity Conflicts**

I have identified a potential discrepancy regarding the ownership of specific parcels in Genesee County, particularly for the third profile. Initial data suggests one owner, while preliminary findings point toward a different individual associated with a local business. I am prioritizing the resolution of this conflict to ensure the accuracy of the underlying property records before proceeding with further analysis.

---

## Thought 29



**Uncovering Local Influence**

I am synthesizing information that suggests one of the individuals may have formal ties to a regional energy project through a land agreement. This would be a significant indicator of their stance on renewable developments. Furthermore, I am investigating potential leadership roles within community organizations, such as local recreational boards, which may help define their public capacity and influence within the township.

---

## Thought 30



**Verifying Official Records**

To finalize these profiles, I am initiating a search of county assessment rolls, tax maps, and municipal planning minutes. My objective is to corroborate the ownership of each parcel and search for any documented public comments or board participation that would clarify the currently unknown stances of these residents regarding local energy initiatives.

---

## Thought 31



**Verifying Property Ownership**

I am currently analyzing records for several land parcels in Genesee County to confirm their ownership status. Preliminary findings suggest a connection between specific tax map identifiers and the individuals Jeffrey Boyce and Brice Johnson, particularly within the Town of Oakfield. I've also identified a likely association between one of these parcels and a large-scale solar energy project, which points toward the existence of a formal land lease agreement with utility developers.

---

## Thought 32



**Resolving Identity Discrepancies**

I have encountered a significant contradiction regarding a specific parcel identifier. While initial information linked this property to Ellen Hersee, local planning and zoning records consistently attribute the same tax map number to Steven Cummings in the Town of Darien. I am working to determine if this is a case of a misplaced identifier or if the ownership has changed, and I will be looking into regional registries to clarify whether the original individual mentioned still holds any property in the area.

---

## Thought 33



**Refining Validated Data**

My next focus is on synthesizing details from official 2024 assessment rolls and regulatory filings related to the Cider Solar project. I'll be looking for specific land agreement summaries and public hearing minutes to provide a definitive confirmation of the owners and their respective lease arrangements, ensuring that the final profile reflects the most current legal and physical land-use data available.

---

**Confirming Project Participation**

I have successfully verified that Brice Johnson is an active participant in a regional renewable energy initiative, having executed a formal lease agreement for his property. This confirmation clarifies his stance as a supporter of local solar developments and provides a concrete link between his land holdings and the project's footprint. I am also exploring indications that he holds a leadership position in a local recreational association, which would further define his influence within the community.

---

## Thought 35



**Rectifying Ownership Discrepancies**

I have resolved a clear contradiction regarding the ownership of a parcel in Darien. While previous data suggested one individual, my analysis of municipal planning and zoning board records confirms that the property belongs to Steven Cummings, who operates a local automotive business. This correction is vital for maintaining the integrity of the neighbor profiles, as it shifts the focus toward an individual with documented engagement in town governance and local commerce.

---

## Thought 36



**Validating Regional Ties**

My next phase involves synthesizing specific municipal records to finalize the connection between Jeffrey Boyce and his suspected land holdings in Oakfield. I am also investigating whether the previously identified individual was a former owner or a neighbor to ensure no relevant local perspectives are overlooked. By corroborating data from official tax rolls and community board archives, I aim to provide a comprehensive view of each individual's professional background and public stance.

---

## Thought 37



**Confirming Local Stakeholders**

I have successfully validated the involvement of one individual who holds a leadership position in a regional recreational organization and has entered into a formal agreement with a utility developer. This confirmation clarifies their supportive stance on local energy infrastructure. Furthermore, I have finalized the identity of a third resident after determining that a previously associated name was likely inaccurate, allowing me to focus on the confirmed owner of the parcel in Darien.

---

## Thought 38



**Resolving Ownership Ambiguity**

A significant information gap remains regarding a specific property in Oakfield. While initial data suggested a particular owner, my analysis of recent tax rolls has yet to show a definitive link between that individual and the identified parcel number. I am currently evaluating whether this indicates a recent transfer of ownership or if the original identifier was misattributed, as establishing this connection is vital for assessing the individual's potential influence.

---

## Thought 39



**Tracing Municipal Records**

I am shifting my investigation toward more granular municipal sources, such as planning board minutes and zoning archives, to find any record of public comments or official participation from the remaining unconfirmed resident. By cross-referencing these local registries with property data, I aim to clarify their role in the community and identify any public positions they have taken regarding land-use changes.

---

## Thought 40



**Validating Regional Records**

I have successfully confirmed the existence and property holdings of Jeffrey Boyce within the Oakfield tax rolls, solidifying his status as a local landowner. By synthesizing data from regional assessment records and regulatory filings, I have also pinpointed the specific timeline of Brice Johnson’s land lease agreement, which clearly defines his supportive stance toward regional energy infrastructure based on officially executed documents from earlier this year.

---

## Thought 41



**Resolving Ownership Contradictions**

I have finalized the correction regarding the land parcel in Darien, definitively identifying Steven Cummings as the owner rather than the individual previously suggested in preliminary data. Through a thorough analysis of municipal planning minutes, I have established his role within the local business community as an automotive shop owner, providing a much clearer picture of his professional background and property usage compared to the initial conflicting reports.

---

## Thought 42



**Synthesizing Final Findings**

Having corroborated all property identifiers, community roles, and formal land agreements, I have reached a point of information sufficiency for each profile. I am now moving to synthesize these verified insights to provide a comprehensive overview of the regional landscape and the specific individuals involved in these land-use developments.

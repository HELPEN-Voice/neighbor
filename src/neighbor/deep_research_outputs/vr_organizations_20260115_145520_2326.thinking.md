## Thought 1

**Initial Research Strategy**

I am initiating the verification process for five specific entities located near a proposed renewable energy development in McHenry County, IL. My strategy involves targeted searches to confirm their basic identity, type, and location, followed by deeper dives into their community influence and any stated positions on renewable energy or development. I am structuring my research to address potential ambiguities for each entity right from the start.

---

## Thought 2



**Addressing Entity Ambiguities**

For several entities, I need to resolve immediate questions. I will specifically search for the exact name and status of 'Union Operating Co LLC' and 'West Grant Develop Inc', including its connection to Donald Franz. For 'John C Tr Et Al Martin', which appears to be a Trust but is flagged as potentially a resident profile, I will prioritize confirming the Trust's legal existence while trying to find context for the individual (John C Martin) within McHenry County, given the necessity to verify all provided profiles.

---

## Thought 3



**Focusing on Organizational Stance**

I will immediately check the 'McHenry County Conservation District' to determine their official stance or historical involvement regarding solar or renewable energy projects, as their position is highly relevant due to their protective role over county resources. I'm also looking to verify the likely individual ownership structure behind 'Burma Rd Grain LLC'.

---

## Thought 4



**Next Steps: Web Search Execution**

I am proceeding with the first batch of targeted searches to gather initial details, principals, and locational context for 'Union Operating Co LLC', 'West Grant Develop Inc', 'Burma Rd Grain LLC', and the 'John C Tr Et Al Martin' entity. I will also perform a focused search for the McHenry County Conservation District's position on renewable energy.

---

## Thought 5



**Clarifying Landowner Stances**

I'm synthesizing search results to confirm the status and stance of key entities. I've found a critical insight regarding **West Grant Development Inc**: contrary to initial assumptions that they might be neutral or holding land speculatively, the search results strongly indicate they are actively the landowner involved in a proposed commercial solar farm project with OneEnergy Development. This suggests a supporting stance for solar development, which resolves a major initial gap in the data.

---

## Thought 6



**Investigating Mysterious LLCs**

I am facing challenges in locating two specific LLCs: **Union Operating Co LLC** and **Burma Rd Grain LLC**. My initial searches for 'Union Operating Co LLC' were inconclusive, often pointing to irrelevant entities like oil and gas companies in Texas or labor unions. Given the McHenry County PINs associated with this name, I suspect it might be a local or misnamed entity, possibly related to a utility or even the town of Union, IL. Similarly, I need to verify the existence and structure of 'Burma Rd Grain LLC' in Illinois. I plan to use highly targeted searches focusing on Illinois corporate records and the local county context to confirm their identities and operations.

---

## Thought 7



**Conservation District's Role**

My research on the **McHenry County Conservation District (MCCD)** confirms their protective role, focusing on reducing their own carbon footprint and installing solar on their buildings. Crucially, I've found evidence that while they require notification and the opportunity to mitigate potential wildlife impacts for projects near their properties, they seem open to collaboration rather than strict opposition. This provides a clear picture of their likely engagement strategy.

---

## Thought 8



**Next Research Steps**

My immediate plan is to execute a new batch of highly focused searches. This includes confirming the principals and the solar lease details for West Grant Development, Inc., verifying the corporate existence and managers of Union Operating Co LLC and Burma Rd Grain LLC in Illinois, and finally, searching for specifics on John C Martin who is likely a trustee in the Marengo/Union area.

---

## Thought 9



**Confirming Landowner Identity and Stance**

I successfully confirmed key details for **West Grant Development Inc**. James Athans is the current President, and the company is the confirmed landowner submitting the petition for a commercial solar facility in Chemung Township. This evidence firmly establishes the entity's stance as 'Support' and their influence as 'High' in relation to the project, updating previous lower-confidence assessments.

---

## Thought 10



**Synthesizing Conservation District Role**

I have also gathered sufficient information on the **McHenry County Conservation District (MCCD)**. Their history shows they don't oppose solar projects outright but demand significant environmental protections, such as large setbacks for protecting oak woodlands. Their stance is best categorized as 'Conditional Support / Protective,' and their influence is high due to their statutory role and land holdings. I observed evidence that their input successfully led to increased setbacks in a similar local solar project.

---

## Thought 11



**Addressing Remaining LLC Ambiguities**

I am facing persistent ambiguity for **Union Operating Co LLC** and **Burma Rd Grain LLC**. General searches were inconclusive, yielding only distant or unrelated entities. To resolve this, I am tightening my search scope for 'Union Operating Co LLC' by explicitly linking it to Illinois state records and considering property identification numbers (PINs) as a direct way to confirm ownership. Similarly, I will execute a highly focused search for 'Burma Rd Grain LLC' within Illinois to locate this specific, likely small, family-owned entity.

---

## Thought 12



**Strategy for Trusts and Trustees**

The entity **John C Tr Et Al Martin** appears to be a Trust associated with a specific property in McHenry County (identified by a PIN). Since the 'Tr' stands for Trustee, I am treating this as an organization profile. My next step is to use the specific property PIN to bypass general name searches and directly identify the owner or associated Trustee in McHenry County records, which should provide context on whether they are a local farmer or a remote investor.

---

## Thought 13



**Verifying Landowner Intent**

I am confirming the status of John C Martin. The search results, including farm subsidy data, strongly suggest that the entity "John C Tr Et Al Martin" is a farming trust in McHenry County. Although no direct public stance on solar has been found, confirming his role as a recipient of agricultural subsidies and a landowner using the associated PIN establishes his activity as agricultural. His stance remains 'unknown' but his entity type is resolved as a Trust/Farmer.

---

## Thought 14



**Resolving Ambiguous LLC Identities**

The identities of **Union Operating Co LLC** and **Burma Rd Grain LLC** remain challenging to verify through standard corporate record searches. The existing data for "Union Operating Co LLC" is heavily skewed toward irrelevant companies (e.g., Texas oil and gas), forcing me to hypothesize about potential typos or local variations. I am now prioritizing searching directly using the associated Property Index Number (PIN) to try and confirm the owner's legal name on record, which is a necessary step before marking the entity as 'Could not verify.' I am also initiating a specific, spelled-out search for 'Burma Road Grain LLC' to eliminate potential minor spelling errors in the initial query.

---

## Thought 15



**Final Targeted Searches**

To finalize the verification stage, I will execute a last batch of highly specific searches. These include attempting to find the owner of PIN 11-31-200-009 directly, re-running the corporate search for 'Union Operating Co LLC' focusing on the Secretary of State records, and attempting the full spelling of 'Burma Road Grain LLC.' Once these targeted checks are complete, I will have sufficient information to compile the final analysis for all entities.

---

## Thought 16

**Verifying Neighbor Identities**

I am initiating the process of verifying five specific profiles in McHenry County, IL, which are crucial neighbors to a potential renewable energy development. My immediate goal is to confirm the existence, business type, and key personnel for entities like Union Operating Co LLC, West Grant Develop Inc, Burma Rd Grain LLC, and the John C Martin Trust, all within the context of McHenry County.

---

## Thought 17



**Focusing on Project Stance and Influence**

A critical part of this audit is determining the stance (support or opposition) and potential influence of these neighbors. I will be looking for connections between West Grant Develop Inc and specific developers like OneEnergy, and checking the McHenry County Conservation District's (MCCD) position on similar local projects, such as the 'Pebble Solar Farm'. This helps anticipate community engagement issues.

---

## Thought 18



**Audit Strategy and Next Steps**

To ensure the highest accuracy, I'm starting with a comprehensive batch of searches aimed at foundational verification. Subsequent steps will involve checking the validity of existing citations, looking for additional relevant news (like lawsuits or community roles), and finally synthesizing all findings into the required JSON structure, while strictly adhering to the rule of removing any specific financial data.

---

## Thought 19



**Confirming Landowner Support**

I have successfully confirmed the existence and operational status of West Grant Development Inc. Crucially, I found definitive evidence that they are the owner of record for a Conditional Use Permit application related to a commercial solar facility in Chemung Township, indicating a clear stance of support for the development. I also synthesized the personnel information, noting that James Athans is the current President, which clarifies the role of the formerly associated representative.

---

## Thought 20



**Understanding Conservation District Nuance**

My research into the McHenry County Conservation District (MCCD) suggests a nuanced, rather than strictly opposing, position. While they are protective of conservation values, they have previously provided input on local solar projects (like the 'Pebble Solar Farm') that focused on preservation requests (setbacks, tree saving) rather than outright opposition. Furthermore, I learned they have their own solar installation, which suggests an overall acceptance of renewable energy when balanced with environmental protection.

---

## Thought 21



**Resolving Ambiguity and Targeting Gaps**

Information regarding 'John C Tr Et Al Martin' has been solidified by finding property and subsidy records, confirming the entity's existence in the region, although their stance on solar remains unknown. The status of 'Union Operating Co LLC' remains the most significant gap. The previous information suggested they are a landowner on development maps, but I need to confirm this specific ownership in McHenry County to distinguish it from similarly named national oil/gas entities. I will conduct targeted searches to verify this specific land ownership claim and the corresponding Duke Energy map reference.

---

## Thought 22



**Next Steps: Evidence Verification**

My next step involves focusing on the most uncertain entity, Union Operating Co LLC, by searching for specific property records and map references within McHenry County. Following that, I plan to access and verify the high-value URLs from previous results, particularly those related to county board meetings and official documents, to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the profiles before finalizing them.

---

## Thought 23



**Strategy Adjustment: Using PINs for Verification**

My initial broad search for "Union Operating Co LLC" in McHenry County was inconclusive, yielding only a very specific PDF that I can't directly access. I've realized a more reliable strategy is to use the specific Property Index Numbers (PINs) provided for this entity, as well as for Burma Rd Grain and John C Martin, to verify the exact owner recorded in public county records. This direct approach will resolve ambiguity regarding the entity's identity and location much faster than broad web searches.

---

## Thought 24



**Confirming Known Entities**

I have collected substantial information on West Grant Development and the McHenry County Conservation District (MCCD) from the initial searches. My next action concerning these two entities is to access the specific meeting minutes URLs identified earlier. This browse action is essential to extract the exact contextual information and direct quotes needed for the final citation requirements.

---

## Thought 25



**Defining Immediate Next Steps**

I am initiating a new set of searches focused solely on matching the provided PINs (`11-31-200-009`, `11-32-100-019`, and `11-32-300-001`) with their registered owners in McHenry County. This verification step is crucial and will immediately follow this reasoning phase, ensuring the foundation of my research is built on concrete property records.

---

## Thought 26



**Major Discovery for Union Operating Co**

I have found a significant new connection for 'Union Operating Co LLC'. A search related to its Parcel Identification Number (PIN) strongly links it to a 'BILLBOARD IMPROVEMENT' survey and a 'Petition for Variation' filed by Clear Channel OUTDOOR LLC. This strongly suggests that Union Operating Co LLC is the landowner that leases space to Clear Channel for a billboard. This discovery helps confirm the entity's presence as a landowner in McHenry County and provides a crucial operational context—they appear to be a land-holding entity.

---

## Thought 27



**Verifying Land Ownership and Location**

To confirm the ownership details and the relationship between Union Operating Co LLC and Clear Channel, I am prioritizing a deeper look into the specific 'Petition for Variation' document found. Confirming the landowner named in this official document will validate the initial finding and move the profile for Union Operating Co LLC from theoretical to fully confirmed. I am also planning a new business registration search for 'Union Operating Co LLC' to find registered agent information.

---

## Thought 28



**Resolving PIN Conflicts and New Searches**

While researching 'John C Martin', I detected a potential false positive where a search returned results from Morgan County instead of the required McHenry County. I have resolved this by relying on the previously confirmed subsidy and location data (Marengo, IL) which firmly places John C Martin in the correct county. For 'Burma Rd Grain LLC', the PIN search was inconclusive, so I am initiating a specific search for the business name to locate its official registration or ownership details, which should help confirm its nature as a local farming entity.

---

## Thought 29



**Next Steps: Document Access and Final Gaps**

My immediate plan is to execute a targeted access of the 'escribemeetings' URL to extract the specific ownership information for the billboard PIN. Following this, I will run verification searches for both 'Burma Rd Grain LLC' and 'Union Operating Co LLC' through official registration channels to fill the remaining gaps concerning their structure and ownership.

---

## Thought 30



**Resolving Owner Identity and Typographical Errors**

I successfully used a specific Property Index Number (PIN) to confirm the owner of record associated with a land parcel. The result showed the owner as 'UNION Openning Company LLC.' Synthesizing this with earlier evidence from a development draft that cited 'Union Operating Co LLC,' I believe 'Openning' is a typo in the official document or the extraction process. I'm operating under the assumption that the correct entity is 'Union Operating Co LLC,' as 'Operating' is standard for a business, and I've confirmed their role as a commercial landowner who leases property for commercial purposes, like billboards.

---

## Thought 31



**Clarifying MCCD's Nuanced Stance**

Accessing official documents confirmed the McHenry County Conservation District’s (MCCD) constructive role regarding local solar projects. Their input on the 'Pebble Solar' project was not outright opposition; instead, they successfully advocated for a revised site plan focused on preserving an old oak grove. This confirms their stance as a **Neutral/Constructive** consultant, ensuring environmental protections are integrated into commercial development.

---

## Thought 32



**Confirming Known Stances**

The ownership of West Grant Development Inc. for the OneEnergy solar petition has been definitively confirmed through property records and associated project documents, establishing their clear stance of **Support** for the development. Conversely, while I confirmed the existence and subsidy receipt for John C Martin, their direct stance on the solar project remains an informational gap.

---

## Thought 33



**Targeting Remaining Gaps**

With key information locked in, I am now focusing on the last two specific areas of uncertainty: verifying the precise, correct name of Union Operating Company LLC and searching for specific registration information for Burma Rd Grain LLC to establish their presence and operational context in Illinois. This targeted effort will complete the foundational verification step before finalizing the profiles.

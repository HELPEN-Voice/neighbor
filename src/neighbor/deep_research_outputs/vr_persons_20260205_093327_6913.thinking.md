## Thought 1

**Establishing Research Parameters**

I am beginning a comprehensive audit of key community figures in Genesee County, New York, to build detailed profiles for George Shamblin, Anne Bezon, and Brian Pritchett. My primary objective is to verify their property ownership and professional roles, specifically looking into their connections with local agricultural operations and advocacy organizations like the Justice for Children Advocacy Center.

---

## Thought 2



**Identifying Information Gaps**

There are currently unanswered questions regarding these individuals' public sentiments toward renewable energy developments. I am looking for evidence of their involvement in community discourse, such as public testimonies or board memberships, to resolve these gaps and understand their potential level of influence on local initiatives.

---

## Thought 3



**Next Steps in Data Verification**

I am proceeding to analyze public records and local news archives to confirm specific land parcel data and professional affiliations. This involves synthesizing information from regional assessment rolls and meeting transcripts to ensure the profiles are accurate and relevant while strictly filtering out any private or sensitive financial information.

---

## Thought 4



**Reconciling Property Records and Vital Statistics**

I have successfully located George Shamblin on a recent regional tax map, confirming his association with a specific land parcel in the Oakfield area. However, I’ve uncovered a potential contradiction: historical records indicate a person of the same name passed away in 2012. I am now synthesizing this information to determine if the property is currently held by an estate or a namesake relative, which is crucial for establishing an accurate profile of the current landowner.

---

## Thought 5



**Connecting Professional Roles to Land Ownership**

My investigation into Anne Bezon has linked her to a prominent county-level advocacy role and a local family farm. Interestingly, I've identified a possible residence for her in a neighboring county, which suggests she may be an absentee landowner or lives just across the border from her holdings. I am working to bridge the gap between her professional identity and her specific property interests to better understand her connection to the local landscape.

---

## Thought 6



**Verifying Ownership and Gauging Sentiment**

To resolve uncertainties regarding Brian Pritchett and confirm the current status of all identified parcels, I am shifting my focus toward analyzing current local assessment rolls and property registries. This will allow me to verify ownership for the remaining land and begin looking deeper into any public statements or filings that might reveal their positions on regional energy developments.

---

## Thought 7



**Clarifying Subject Profiles**

I have made significant progress in refining the status of the primary subjects. I've discovered through recent records that George Shamblin is deceased, which shifts the focus of my research to his estate and his son as the actual points of contact for the property. Additionally, I’ve uncovered evidence that Brian Pritchett has executed a right-of-way easement for a local project. This is a major insight, as it indicates a level of active participation or cooperation with regional infrastructure developments that was previously unconfirmed.

---

## Thought 8



**Reconciling Property Records**

I am currently resolving a discrepancy regarding land holdings and professional roles. While Anne Bezon is linked to a prominent local farming family, I am cross-referencing her professional background in advocacy with specific agricultural parcels to ensure accurate identification. I am also investigating whether certain tax records still reflect the deceased owner's name or have been updated to an estate status, which is a critical detail for establishing the current management of those land interests.

---

## Thought 9



**Investigating Project Participation**

Moving forward, I will be synthesizing information from land title surveys and project indices to determine if these individuals are directly involved in major solar initiatives like the Excelsior or Cider Solar projects. I plan to analyze regional assessment rolls to confirm the exact township and parcel boundaries for each subject. This will allow me to finalize their profiles by establishing whether they are participating landowners or simply adjacent neighbors to these developments.

---

## Thought 10



**Clarifying Property Ownership and Intent**

I have successfully resolved the ambiguity surrounding one of the land parcels by confirming it is currently held by an estate following recent passings in the family, with a successor now managing the property's interests. Additionally, I’ve identified that another landowner has formally moved from a neutral position to a supporting role by executing a right-of-way easement for a regional energy project, marking a significant step in documenting participant engagement.

---

## Thought 11



**Reconciling Residency and Local Influence**

In synthesizing recent tax records, I am refining my understanding of residency status for these individuals. I've observed that a key figure previously thought to be an absentee owner appears to be a resident whose family operates a high-impact agricultural enterprise in the area. This connection between local professional advocacy and large-scale farming provides a clearer picture of her potential influence on community land-use decisions.

---

## Thought 12



**Determining Final Stances and Affiliations**

My next phase of analysis involves evaluating whether the lack of executed agreements for certain parcels stems from ongoing negotiations or active opposition. I am planning to investigate public testimonies and community meeting records to see if these families or their business entities have expressed formal support or concerns, which will allow me to finalize their profiles with a high degree of confidence.

---

## Thought 13



**Verifying Residential and Educational Ties**

I have pinpointed the exact residence for Anne Bezon in the Town of Elba, identifying it as a single-family property. I also confirmed her educational background within the local school district, which solidifies her longstanding personal and professional ties to the community and provides a more complete picture of her local roots.

---

## Thought 14



**Confirming Local Farming Lineage**

A significant insight I have uncovered is the Bezon family's distinct role in the region's agricultural history, specifically as one of the few remaining families engaged in muckland farming. I have successfully linked her to a major local farm operation, resolving previous uncertainties about her family's land-based influence and the nature of their agricultural holdings.

---

## Thought 15



**Synthesizing Final Research Findings**

Now that I have reconciled the contradictions regarding land management and verified the specific roles of each individual, I am synthesizing these insights into a final overview. I am concluding my search as I have obtained the necessary details to map the connections between these figures and their respective regional interests.

---

## Thought 16

**Initial Profile Assessment**

I am beginning the verification process for three key neighbor profiles in Genesee County to ensure they are accurate and fully supported by evidence. I have identified specific leads to investigate, such as the reported passing of a primary contact and his spouse, the professional affiliations of another resident with a local advocacy center, and potential land agreements already in place for the renewable energy project.

---

## Thought 17



**Addressing Profile Uncertainties**

My primary focus is resolving the current occupancy and ownership status of the Shamblin estate and confirming the exact nature of existing easements. I am also looking to reconcile personal professional roles with family business interests, specifically regarding agricultural operations in the area, to determine how these connections might influence project involvement or stance.

---

## Thought 18



**Execution of Verification Strategy**

I am initiating a targeted search into public records, obituary databases, and project-specific filings like land title surveys and noise modeling reports. By synthesizing information from professional registries and local land records, I will substantiate the identity and influence of each individual before finalizing their profiles.

---

## Thought 19



**Confirming Estate Details**

I have successfully confirmed that George Shamblin is deceased, verifying this through recent records identifying his spouse and their long-term residence in Oakfield. This provides a clearer picture of the estate's status as I investigate how their land holdings are factored into the regional energy project.

---

## Thought 20



**Reconciling Project Roles**

I am currently synthesizing information regarding local residents and their proximity to the proposed solar infrastructure. While I have identified active agricultural entities linked to the project exhibits, I am working to resolve gaps concerning specific professional affiliations and the accuracy of noise modeling data reported for these locations. This involves weighing conflicting details about parcel participation to ensure the research reflects the true impact on each individual.

---

## Thought 21



**Verifying Land Agreements**

My next focus is to analyze specific property records and project layout documentation to confirm the exact status of various land parcels. I will be looking to distinguish between land under easement options and non-participating properties to accurately map out the project's reach and the specific rights associated with each resident's land.

---

## Thought 22



**Verifying Formal Agreements**

I have successfully located documented evidence of a fully executed right-of-way easement for one resident, confirming their formal participation in the project as of mid-2023. I am also synthesizing information from recent land title indexes that place another resident's property in the immediate vicinity of the proposed project infrastructure, though I am still determining the exact nature of their involvement.

---

## Thought 23



**Resolving Participant Status**

A significant point of clarification involves distinguishing between project participants and adjacent neighbors. While some survey maps label properties as belonging to certain individuals, the terminology used suggests they may be bordering the project rather than granting easements themselves. I am also reconciling conflicting residency data for one individual to confirm if their current professional roles align with the ownership of specific local parcels.

---

## Thought 24



**Analyzing Updated Registries**

I am proceeding to examine detailed land title indexes and the most recent county assessment rolls to verify the current ownership of the remaining target properties. By cross-referencing these official filings with professional directories and local agricultural records, I will ensure each profile accurately reflects the individual's current status and relationship to the energy project.

---

## Thought 25



**Validating Residential Connections**

I have successfully linked a key resident to a specific parcel on Lockport Road and confirmed her professional history with a regional advocacy center. Additionally, I’ve established a connection between her property and a long-standing local farming family, which helps contextualize her position within the community and her geographic proximity to the proposed infrastructure.

---

## Thought 26



**Resolving Parcel Discrepancies**

I am currently working through a contradiction regarding a neighbor's land involvement. While initial data suggested a specific parcel identifier, recent project records indicate a right-of-way easement registered to a different property. I am also scrutinizing whether a neighboring estate is directly subject to a proposed easement or is simply adjacent to project activities, as the terminology in available survey maps requires more precise interpretation.

---

## Thought 27



**Clarifying Property Rights**

My next step is to conduct a targeted examination of land records and project-specific survey maps to reconcile these conflicting identifiers. I will focus on determining the precise boundaries of participation for these residents to ensure I accurately distinguish between those who have signed formal land agreements and those who are categorized strictly as non-participating neighbors.

---

## Thought 28



**Refining Project Participation**

I have successfully identified a formal land agreement that clarifies one resident's involvement, confirming them as a documented project participant rather than just a neighboring property owner. Additionally, I have substantiated specific professional roles that align with the project's historical timeline, providing a more robust foundation for the biographical details of these individuals.

---

## Thought 29



**Resolving Documentation Discrepancies**

I am addressing previous information gaps by correcting the record where residents were thought to be absent from local filings. My synthesis of land title documents revealed specific easements that were previously overlooked. I have also reconciled occupation data with residential status to accurately distinguish between those with deep-rooted agricultural ties and those primarily representing private residential interests.

---

## Thought 30



**Synthesizing Final Profiles**

I am now moving to aggregate these findings into a final verified structure, ensuring that each entity's classification and stance are accurately reflected based on the most recent land records and professional affiliations. My focus is on finalizing the evidentiary mapping to ensure every claim is backed by the specific documentation discovered during this process.

Two LLCs (Big Willow Ranch LLC and Willows Ranch LLC) control thousands of acres of ranchland in Payette County – including a 12,900± acre ranch that recently changed hands – indicating significant land investments. They have no publicly stated positions on development, but their operations (irrigated feedlot, cattle grazing, and private hunting) suggest they could be protective of water resources, agricultural use, and the rural landscape. These landholders possess substantial acreage and resources, making them potentially influential if they choose to support or oppose new development in the area.",

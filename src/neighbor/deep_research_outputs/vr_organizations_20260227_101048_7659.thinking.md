---

## Thought 23



**Untangling Utility Jurisdictions**

I am currently reconciling a discrepancy between the Municipal Authority and a separate Sewer Authority regarding a $2 million wastewater grant. While some records attribute this project to the water utility, others point to the sewer entity; I am synthesizing information from recent meeting minutes to determine if these organizations operate independently or under a shared administrative structure.

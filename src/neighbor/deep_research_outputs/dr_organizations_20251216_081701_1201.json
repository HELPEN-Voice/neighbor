No active business operations or corporate history for this LLC are evident beyond property ownership (implying it functions as a landholding vehicle) ([ecorp.azcc.gov](https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessID=2536502#:~:text=Entity%20Information%20Search%20Date%20and,Date%3A%207%2F26%2F2022%20Status%20Date%3A%207%2F26%2F2022)). The lack of news or filings on this entity suggests it is likely controlled by an individual or investment group quietly speculating on land ([ecorp.azcc.gov](https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessID=2536502#:~:text=Entity%20Information%20Search%20Date%20and,Date%3A%207%2F26%2F2022%20Status%20Date%3A%207%2F26%2F2022)). There are no recorded development plans or known improvements on its parcels, indicating the land is being passively held at this time ([ecorp.azcc.gov](https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessID=2536502#:~:text=Entity%20Information%20Search%20Date%20and,Date%3A%207%2F26%2F2022%20Status%20Date%3A%207%2F26%2F2022)).\",\n      \"community_influence\": \"Low\",\n      \"influence_justification\": \"Unknown principals; no public profile or community engagement; appears to be a passive land investor\",\n      \"entity_classification\": \"speculation\",\n      \"potential_motivators\": [\"Future land sale profit\", \"Maintaining property value\", \"Avoiding land use that limits resale potential\"],\n      \"approach_recommendations\": \"Attempt to identify the managing member through county records; approach with potential purchase or incentive that realizes a return on their parcels, addressing any concerns about project impacts on land value\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"neighbor_id\": \"N-04\",\n      \"name\": \"Ci351 Peoria Logistics LLC / Douglas Peoria Logistics LLC\",\n      \"entity_category\": \"Organization\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"llc\",\n      \"pins\": [\"14220156\"],\n      \"claims\": \"Ci351 Peoria Logistics LLC (also referenced as Douglas Peoria Logistics LLC) appears to be an entity involved in industrial development, given its name and holdings ([www.bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2024/04/22/traders-joes-frito-lay-peoria-logistics-park.html#:~:text=Two%20major%20food,as%20it%20gets%20built%20out)).

The exact ownership is not publicly documented, but the “Douglas” moniker suggests affiliation with a developer named Douglas or a related company.

This entity owns multiple adjacent parcels, suggesting a family-held land investment possibly for future development or sale.

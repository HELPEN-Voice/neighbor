Principal Marlin Murdoch serves as the Chairman of the Lower Republican Natural Resources District (LRNRD) Board of Directors, a powerful local regulatory body ([LRNRD Board of Directors](https://lrnrd.org/about/board-of-directors)). In his capacity as LRNRD Chair, Murdoch has overseen the district's participation in the Nebraska Cooperative Republican Platte Enhancement Project (NCORPE). In July 2020, the NCORPE board voted to enter into a lease agreement with renewable energy developer Invenergy to study solar and wind resources on NCORPE property ([LRNRD Minutes Aug 2020](https://lrnrd.org/meeting/minutes/2020/817-minutes-8-13-2020/file)). Furthermore, in June 2019, the LRNRD board provided consensus that they \"would like revenue from the land (renewables, grain production, and grazing) to support operational cost\" ([LRNRD Minutes June 2019](https://lrnrd.org/meeting/minutes/2019/724-minutes-6-13-19/file)).",

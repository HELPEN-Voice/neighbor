In Schuylkill County, the agency is a major landholder, owning parcels such as State Game Lands identified in tax records ([Schuylkill Parcel Locator](https://gis.vgsi.com/SchuylkillCountyPA/Parcel.aspx?pid=889)). While the Commission has established a 'Wind Energy Voluntary Cooperative Agreement' to guide developers in minimizing wildlife impacts on private land ([PA Game Commission](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/about-us/agency-business-center/wind-energy)), it has historically maintained a strict moratorium on wind turbine development directly on State Game Lands, citing incompatibility with habitat conservation ([Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com/powersource/policy-powersource/2018/04/27/pennsylvania-game-commission-wind-energy-ban/stories/201804270124)).

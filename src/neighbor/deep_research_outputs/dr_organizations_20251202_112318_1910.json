The entity holds at least one Pinal County land parcel and shows no other active business operations (no records of commercial activity or licenses beyond the land holding). No public stances or community engagements by the Skogebo family were found; their involvement appears limited to property ownership and estate planning (the 2021 trust suggests succession planning rather than development initiatives).\",\n      \"community_influence\": \"Medium\",\n      \"influence_justification\": \"Owns sizable parcel; family trust structure implies generational hold, but not outwardly active in local affairs\",\n      \"entity_classification\": \"land_investment\",\n      \"potential_motivators\": [\"Long-term asset appreciation\", \"Family wealth preservation\", \"Eventual sale for development\"],\n      \"approach_recommendations\": \"Engage the Skogebo family (through David or Jocelyn) diplomatically to understand their long-term plans.

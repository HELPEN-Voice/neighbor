## Thought 1

**Identifying Project Connections**

I am initiating a focused investigation into several residents within Genesee County to clarify their roles and perspectives regarding local renewable energy developments, specifically the Cider Solar project. My primary objective is to verify property ownership and determine if there are any documented affiliations between these individuals and project developers like Hecate Energy.

---

## Thought 2



**Reconciling Property Participation**

I have identified a need to resolve a discrepancy regarding Brett Jasinski's involvement; while preliminary data suggests he may have signed a land lease, his formal stance remains unconfirmed. I am looking to see if this participation indicates a supportive position. Additionally, for Makayla Friedl and Scott Mabon, current information is sparse, so I am prioritizing the verification of their specific land parcels and any public footprints they may have left in local planning records.

---

## Thought 3



**Investigating Local Records**

I will now begin synthesizing information from public property registries, project-specific landowner lists, and community meeting minutes. By cross-referencing these sources, I aim to build a verified account of each individual's influence and public sentiment toward energy infrastructure in their region.

---

## Thought 4



**Identifying Project Documentation**

I have uncovered a tax agreement related to the Cider Solar project that references a specific list of participating landowners. While the specific names weren't immediately visible in the initial overview, finding this official document provides a clear path to verifying the involvement of the individuals I am investigating through their legal connections to the project.

---

## Thought 5



**Resolving Name Ambiguities**

I noticed that some individuals, such as Scott Mabon and Makayla Friedl, are not appearing in immediate local searches, or are returning results for historical figures rather than current residents. This highlights a gap where names might be misspelled in the draft or property ownership might be registered under different entities, which I need to reconcile.

---

## Thought 6



**Strategic Verification Shift**

To move forward, I am shifting my focus toward official county mapping and assessment data. By synthesizing information from specific parcel identifiers, I intend to confirm the current legal owners and resolve any discrepancies between the public records and the names provided in the research materials.

---

## Thought 7



**Refining Property Records**

I have successfully cross-referenced municipal documents and uncovered a discrepancy regarding ownership dates for a key parcel. While earlier tax rolls suggested a commercial farm entity held the land, more recent records from 2025 indicate a transfer to an individual resident. I have also verified that another resident is officially listed in town records, confirming their direct connection to the area under study.

---

## Thought 8



**Resolving Geographical Discrepancies**

I am currently reconciling conflicting data where identical parcel identification numbers appear in different counties across the state. By filtering out irrelevant listings from unrelated jurisdictions, I am narrowing down the exact location of a third resident’s holdings to ensure the research remains focused strictly on the local solar development zone.

---

## Thought 9



**Investigating Project Affiliations**

I am now moving to verify specific claims regarding signed land leases and participation in the regional energy project. I will be synthesizing information from project-specific filings and community planning archives to determine if these residents have formally committed their land to the development or if they have voiced any public opinions during local proceedings.

---

## Thought 10



**Clarifying Ownership Records**

I have successfully cross-referenced several property parcels with recent local records, confirming that the land previously attributed to Brett Jasinski is officially registered to Richard A. Jasinski in project documentation. Furthermore, I have reconciled a discrepancy regarding Scott Mabon’s property; while older records pointed to a farm entity, recent meeting minutes from 2025 confirm him as the current owner of record for his specific parcel.

---

## Thought 11



**Verifying Lease Participation**

I am currently resolving a contradiction between the initial research draft and legal project exhibits. While the draft identifies certain individuals as participating landowners who have signed long-term leases, I need to verify if their presence in the project area maps signifies formal participation or simply proximity. Specifically, I am investigating whether Richard A. Jasinski is the signatory for the agreement originally linked to the Jasinski name.

---

## Thought 12



**Assessing Regional Stances**

My next phase involves synthesizing details from specific project exhibits to confirm the 'participating' status of these landowners. I will also be searching for any public footprints or documented influence these individuals may have within the community to determine their personal stances on the local energy infrastructure developments.

---

## Thought 13



**Correcting Identity Discrepancies**

I have identified a significant naming discrepancy between the initial records and official project documentation regarding property ownership. While a "Brett Jasinski" was previously mentioned, legal maps for the solar development area explicitly list Richard A. Jasinski as the owner. I am currently evaluating familial connections to determine if the initial identification referred to a resident relative rather than the legal titleholder, ensuring the profile accurately reflects the individual tied to the land agreement.

---

## Thought 14



**Assessing Resident Involvement**

I have successfully confirmed the current land ownership for Makayla Friedl and Scott Mabon. However, while their residency and parcel locations are verified, I have found no public record of their personal sentiment toward the local energy project, leaving their formal stance as unknown. Conversely, the presence of the Jasinski property on official project maps provides a stronger indication of formal participation which I am now reconciling with reports of signed long-term lease options.

---

## Thought 15



**Validating Final Affiliations**

I am moving toward a final synthesis of local records to clarify the relationship between these residents and to confirm if any additional family members are involved in the development. Once these connections are established, I will finalize the profiles by integrating the newly confirmed property data and documented project affiliations into a comprehensive overview of their roles in the regional energy landscape.

---

## Thought 16



**Verifying Legal Ownership**

I have confirmed through specific project mapping that a primary parcel is legally held by Richard A. Jasinski, allowing me to refine the identity of the individual involved in the project. My review of 2025 county planning records has also provided definitive ownership links for the remaining residents under study, placing them clearly within the local development framework.

---

## Thought 17



**Reconciling Project Participation**

I am resolving the ambiguity surrounding land-use agreements by evaluating whether a parcel's inclusion in official project exhibits constitutes an active endorsement or simply a geographic reality. By cross-referencing these maps with meeting transcripts, I am determining if a resident's status as a 'participating landowner' effectively serves as a proxy for their support of the local energy infrastructure.

---

## Thought 18



**Finalizing Profile Verification**

I am now synthesizing the information gathered to finalize the resident profiles, ensuring all citations lead to the specific exhibits and meeting minutes identified. I will finish updating the records to reflect these verified names and the exact nature of their properties within the development zone.

---

## Thought 19

**Validating Community Profiles**

I am beginning a detailed audit of neighbor profiles associated with the Cider Solar project in Genesee County. My focus is on verifying property ownership, community influence, and public stances regarding renewable energy development to ensure the accuracy of the local stakeholder landscape.

---

## Thought 20



**Addressing Ownership Discrepancies**

I’ve identified a potential contradiction in the initial data regarding a parcel previously attributed to Brett Jasinski; preliminary evidence suggests Richard A. Jasinski may be the true owner and a participating leaseholder. Additionally, I am investigating recent property transfers from local agricultural entities to confirm the current ownership status for the remaining profiles.

---

## Thought 21



**Cross-Referencing Records**

My next steps involve synthesizing information from regional property databases and official project filings. I will be looking for documented lease agreements and public meeting minutes to clarify each individual's role and stance within the community while adhering to strict data verification protocols.

---

## Thought 22



**Local Family Connections**

I have uncovered promising leads linking the Jasinski family to the Oakfield area through local records, which helps anchor the ownership context for the first parcel. I am also analyzing county meeting documents and project exhibits from the past year that list participating landowners, providing a framework for identifying the parties involved in the regional solar development.

---

## Thought 23



**Resolving Ownership Ambiguities**

I am currently synthesizing conflicting information regarding parcel 16.-1-23, where different family members appear in various records. I am also investigating whether the individuals identified in recent documents are the primary owners of their respective parcels or if the land is held under a broader family-held entity, which will clarify the relationship between the residents and the properties in question.

---

## Thought 24



**Mapping Official Land Records**

I will now proceed to cross-reference these findings with official tax assessment rolls and agricultural land registries. My next priority is to resolve the naming discrepancies and definitively link each individual to their specific parcel, ensuring the accuracy of the ownership data before I look deeper into their specific involvement with the solar project.

---

## Thought 25



**Verifying Landowner Identities**

I have successfully confirmed that Richard A. Jasinski is the owner of the key parcel associated with the solar project's substation and switchyard, clarifying a naming discrepancy from earlier reports. Furthermore, I have positively identified the current owners of the Oakfield properties through recent municipal records, placing them within the context of the county's agricultural districts.

---

## Thought 26



**Resolving Geographic Ambiguities**

I navigated a challenge involving identical parcel identifiers found in multiple counties, successfully isolating the data relevant to Genesee County. I am now synthesizing information that distinguishes between individuals who are active project participants and those whose names appear in public records solely due to regional farmland preservation initiatives.

---

## Thought 27



**Investigating Community Impact**

I am moving forward by investigating the professional backgrounds and civic roles of these individuals to better understand their community influence. My next steps involve searching for specific documentation that validates the extent of local participation in long-term agreements and determining if any distinct public stances have been voiced in recent local sessions.

---

## Thought 28



**Confirming Project Participation**

I have synthesized data from official project exhibits which place a key parcel directly within the designated development zone. This inclusion is a significant finding, as it strongly indicates that the owner is a participating leaseholder rather than an adjacent resident. By analyzing the project area map, I’ve concluded that this individual’s involvement is integral to the solar facility's footprint.

---

## Thought 29



**Rectifying Record Discrepancies**

I have successfully resolved the naming contradictions identified in earlier stages by prioritizing land-use filings over informal records. Thinking through the family lineage and property history has allowed me to correct the primary stakeholder’s name and verify that other identified individuals are private citizens with no public record of opposition or support, effectively narrowing the scope of active influence.

---

## Thought 30



**Finalizing Profile Accuracy**

I am now moving to integrate these validated ownership details and participation statuses into the final assessment. With the parcel IDs confirmed through regional planning documents and agricultural registries, I am ready to conclude the research process and provide an updated, evidence-based view of the local stakeholder landscape.

Once these foundational facts are checked, I will pivot to researching Cary Joe & Jennifer Turner and David & Shari Stephens, who currently lack public claims."

I recognize that opposition to environmental pollution from one industry does not automatically translate to an 'oppose' stance on renewable energy development projects. I will focus my search on verifying the existence of this letter and then making specific searches to find his stance on solar or wind projects.

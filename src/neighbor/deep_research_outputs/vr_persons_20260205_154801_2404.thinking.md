## Thought 2



**Resolving Entity Discrepancies**

I've identified a need to reconcile the classification of the Gardiner Cemetery. While the initial documentation categorizes it as an individual, I am thinking through its status as a municipal or religious organization. I will be looking for management details, such as board oversight or town maintenance, to ensure the profile accurately reflects its community role and organizational structure.

---

## Thought 3



**Investigating Stakeholder Perspectives**

My next steps involve synthesizing information from local records and public archives to uncover any public statements or community roles held by Thomas Elliott and Glenda Bloom. I intend to search for any mentions of these individuals in local discourse regarding renewable energy developments to determine their potential influence or stance on the project.

## Thought 4



**Pinpointing the Project Location**

I have successfully identified that the area of interest is situated within the Town of Elba and the Town of Oakfield in Genesee County. Specifically, I found that the Gardiner Cemetery is integrated into the landscape of a major local energy project, likely situated near Lockport Road. This connection to a specific regional development provides a crucial anchor for the rest of my investigation into the surrounding land parcels.

---

## Thought 5



**Resolving Ownership Ambiguities**

While examining the cemetery's status, I noticed a discrepancy in how the land is categorized. Although it functions as a burial ground, I am looking into whether it is managed by a dedicated association or treated as an enclave within a private parcel. Determining its exact legal structure—whether it acts as an organizational entity or an individual landholding—is essential for accurately mapping the stakeholders involved in local land-use discussions.

---

## Thought 6

I am thinking through whether these discrepancies arise from outdated records or if the parcels have transitioned to different individuals since the initial project surveys were conducted.

---

## Thought 12



**Verifying Municipal Records**

To bridge these information gaps, I am shifting my strategy to focus on specific tax map identifiers within the regional assessment rolls. By targeting these unique parcel numbers directly, I intend to bypass the ambiguity of common names and pinpoint the current registered owners. My next steps involve cross-referencing these identifiers with municipal data to confirm the precise relationship between the land parcels and the individuals I am researching.

---

## Thought 13



**Verifying Property Locations**

I have successfully identified specific tax map identifiers associated with the regional solar development, confirming that these parcels are clustered within the Elba area. By cross-referencing local community records, I have also confirmed the residency of one key individual in the town, which provides a concrete starting point for linking specific stakeholders to the project's footprint.

## Thought 14



**Mapping Site Relationships**

I am thinking through the spatial relationship between private holdings and the Gardiner Cemetery. New information suggests the cemetery is located within a larger property at 3815 Lockport Road, which may be a private residence or farm. I am working to resolve whether this surrounding land is owned by one of the individuals I am researching or if it belongs to a separate entity, as this will clarify the layout of the project's stakeholders.

---

## Thought 15



**Linking Stakeholders to Records**

My next phase involves synthesizing property assessment data to explicitly connect the names provided to their respective tax map IDs. I am also expanding my search to identify any mentions of these individuals in regional land records or trusts, particularly to find more information on those who haven't yet appeared in local residency directories.

---

## Thought 16



**Verifying Stakeholder Residency**

I have successfully located one of the primary stakeholders in local community records, confirming their residency in the immediate area. By synthesizing regional map data with specific tax identifiers, I have established a direct link between these individuals and the parcels situated within the development’s footprint, providing the necessary evidence of their stake in the project.

---

## Thought 17



**Clarifying Property Status**

I am resolving the uncertainty regarding the cemetery's legal status by confirming it exists as a standalone tax parcel rather than a simple easement. My review of project-specific planning documents reveals that the site is being treated with specific protective measures, and I am reclassifying it from an individual landholding to an organizational entity to better reflect its role in the community landscape.

---

## Thought 18



**Synthesizing Final Profiles**

My next phase involves consolidating these verified details into comprehensive profiles. I am thinking through the implications of the stakeholders' lack of public commentary, as despite confirming their land ownership, my searches in municipal archives and public meeting records have not uncovered any formal stances or personal statements regarding the local development.

## Thought 19

**Establishing Project Context**

I have identified that the neighbor profiles are likely centered around the Cider Solar development in the towns of Elba and Oakfield. By connecting specific parcel IDs to this geographic area, I am beginning to narrow down the community roles and property interests of the individuals involved, particularly focusing on their proximity to key infrastructure like Lockport Road.

---

## Thought 20



**Verifying Influence and Ownership**

There is a need to reconcile specific land ownership records with local leadership roles to understand each neighbor's potential influence. I am looking to confirm whether these individuals hold positions on local councils or planning boards, which will help clarify if their perspectives carry weight in local development decisions or zoning discussions.

---

## Thought 21



**Mapping the Local Landscape**

I will now proceed by synthesizing property tax data with community leadership directories. My objective is to validate the ownership of the designated parcels and investigate any public records that might indicate the stances or official affiliations of these stakeholders within Genesee County.

---

## Thought 22



**Verifying Protected Sites**

I have successfully mapped the Gardiner Cemetery to its specific location in Elba, New York, confirming its status as a protected neighbor within the project's scope. My analysis of site mitigation documents shows that there are active plans for vegetative screening and avoidance to preserve the cemetery's integrity, marking a clear connection between the project's development and the preservation of this specific land parcel.

---

## Thought 23



**Resolving Geographic Ambiguities**

During my investigation, I identified a potential data conflict where common names led to results in a different state. I am now filtering out irrelevant information from Michigan to ensure all findings regarding the individuals in question are strictly tied to Genesee County, New York. While I have found a promising lead connecting one individual to a local pastoral council, I am still working to establish a clear stance on the project for others whose public information is more limited.

---

## Thought 24



**Refining Stakeholder Profiles**

My next steps involve synthesizing local property data with specific tax map identifiers to confirm ownership and residency. I will focus on exploring community-specific records and local regional documents to uncover any formal comments or public stances regarding the solar development, ensuring each profile is accurately linked to the correct New York parcels.

Furthermore, I have confirmed that the local cemetery is a significant site within the solar project's footprint, currently subject to specific visual mitigation and screening plans to ensure its preservation during development.

---

## Thought 26



**Investigating Ownership Discrepancies**

While I have gathered substantial data on several entities, one property owner remains unverified. I am investigating whether this is due to a name variation in official records or if the property was recently subdivided from a larger adjacent tract, which would explain the lack of a direct match in initial property records.

---

## Thought 27



**Cross-Referencing Official Records**

I am moving toward a more granular analysis of municipal tax registries and property rolls. My objective is to reconcile the remaining identity gaps by checking for alternative name spellings and verifying specific parcel IDs within the local government archives to finalize the stakeholder profiles.

---

## Thought 28



**Connecting Community Roles**

I have successfully confirmed a connection between one of the individuals and a local pastoral council, which adds a layer of community influence to their profile. I am also identifying patterns in property tax map sequences that suggest specific individuals may hold adjacent parcels, indicating a potential familial or geographic cluster that could influence local sentiment toward the project.

---

## Thought 29



**Addressing Ownership Gaps**

I am currently resolving a lack of direct evidence regarding the ownership of one specific parcel. While the existing project documentation makes certain claims, I have yet to find independent verification in public records. I am working to determine if this individual is a recent owner or if the name is associated with the property under a slightly different legal variation to ensure the accuracy of the stakeholder map.

---

## Thought 30



**Exploring Project Compliance Filings**

My next step involves synthesizing data from solar project compliance filings and environmental documents, which often contain detailed neighbor lists and land-use maps. I will focus on cross-referencing names with specific addresses along Lockport Road to solidify ownership records and identify any public stances or concerns that may have been raised during the project's planning phases.

---

## Thought 31



**Identifying Name Discrepancies**

I have uncovered a significant discrepancy regarding a property owner's identity. While initial data suggested one surname, official project documentation for a specific land parcel indicates a different last name. I am now investigating whether this is a case of a name change, a typo, or a complete misidentification, as ensuring the accuracy of this profile is vital for understanding the neighbor's potential influence.

---

## Thought 32



**Validating Property Associations**

I am currently scrutinizing the connection between residents and their reported land identifiers to prevent further inaccuracies. While the location and role of the local cemetery remain well-documented, I am re-evaluating the links for other neighbors to ensure they are correctly associated with the parcels adjacent to the development. This involves cross-referencing regional records to confirm that the names provided match the current legal owners.

---

## Thought 33



**Strengthening Identity Records**

My next objective is to synthesize information regarding these specific individuals within Genesee County to clarify their roles. I will look for public records that might explain the naming inconsistencies and search for any documented public comments or affiliations that would indicate their perspective on the local solar project, ensuring each profile reflects the most current and verified data.

---

## Thought 34



**Confirming Ownership and Community Roles**

I have successfully verified the ownership of key parcels by cross-referencing project-specific tax exhibits with local records, resolving previous questions about property identifiers. Additionally, I have pinpointed official leadership roles through community directory data, providing concrete evidence of the social influence and residency of the individuals within the development area.

---

## Thought 35

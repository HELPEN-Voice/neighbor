I will begin by searching for the company via the West Virginia Secretary of State and local Hardy County records to confirm basic details."

All the land in the company is farm land.\" This evidence strongly suggests a reclassification from 'land investment' to **'agriculture'** is necessary for the profile.

His public quote regarding the project—calling it a \"game-changer\" and part of their commitment to \"investing in our community\"—signals a clear **'support'** stance for renewable energy initiatives, at least in the context of distributed generation.

This entity appears to be noise and is not connected to the Hardy County entity. Given that Samuel Williams represents a 9th-generation local family and operates both a farm and a key community hub (South Branch Inn), I assess his local influence level as **Medium**."

To address this, I will perform targeted searches using \"Samuel Williams Moorefield solar\" to look for comments on broader projects and perform a final check on the company's agricultural focus using terms like \"cattle\" or \"poultry\" before compiling the final refined profile."

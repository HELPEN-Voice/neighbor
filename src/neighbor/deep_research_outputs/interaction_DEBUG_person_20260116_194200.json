My core task is to verify identity, community stance, level of influence, and source citations for each profile while ensuring all personal and financial data is sanitized. I've analyzed the initial claims for each profile—from deceased residents with estates (N-01) and complex family arrangements (N-03, N-04) to long-term landowners (N-05)."

For the Wolfe profiles (N-03, N-04), the inclusion of 'Life' in the name string suggests a Life Estate arrangement, which I need to either confirm or infer from general land record practices. Additionally, the citation for the Bosley profile (N-05) referencing a 1940 Census is inadequate for verifying current owners, requiring me to find more contemporary data."

The family has explicitly opposed utility-scale solar development in the Town of Vienna; Sherri Meinholz, a manager at the dairy, stated publicly that losing prime farmland to the Great Dane solar project would threaten the land base required for feed crops and manure spreading ([madisoncommons.org](https://madisoncommons.org/massive-solar-project-could-change-the-landscape-in-rural-dane-county/)). In 2019, a related entity (Meinholz, LLC) litigated against the Town of Springfield regarding nonconforming use rights for a quarry on their property, demonstrating a willingness to engage in legal action over land-use regulations ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/wi-court-of-appeals/2171703.html)). Family patriarch Art Meinholz, who served on the Town of Springfield Board and the Yahara Pride Farms board, passed away in January 2026, though the family remains civically active ([cressfuneralservice.com](https://www.cressfuneralservice.com/obituaries/arthur-meinholz)).",

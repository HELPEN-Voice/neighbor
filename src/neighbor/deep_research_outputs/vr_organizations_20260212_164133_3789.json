Simplot, initially holding significant family assets including stock and real estate([Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/idaho/iddce/1:2007cv00484/21493/14/)). The partnership holds title to agricultural properties in Payette County, as confirmed by Idaho Department of Water Resources service lists and oil/gas permitting records from the Idaho Oil and Gas Conservation Commission([IDWR](https://idwr.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/districts/Declaration-of-Proof-of-Service.pdf)). Historically, the entity was central to litigation during Don Simplot's 2007 bankruptcy, where family members successfully opposed the liquidation of DJS assets, arguing it would violate the partnership agreement([US Courts](https://www.id.uscourts.gov/content_fetcher/decision.cfml/In_re_Simplot_1786.pdf?Decision_ID=1786)). The entity has also engaged in land use applications in other Idaho counties, such as a record of survey application in Valley County to adjust lot lines for family trust properties([Valley County](https://evogov.s3.amazonaws.com/media/141/media/147325.pdf)).",

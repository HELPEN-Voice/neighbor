In Payette County, the entity developed a major livestock facility along Big Willow Creek, described in real estate records as a 14,534-head Confined Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) and feedlot situated on approximately 890 acres ([RJ Realty](https://www.rjrealty.com/-/listing/ID-SIRMLS/98916193/6075-Big-Willow-Rd-Payette-ID-83661)). The operation faced significant financial restructuring; in early 2025, the entity and its principals were defendants in a lawsuit brought by Rooster Capital IV LLC, resulting in a Judgment, Decree of Foreclosure, and a Sheriff's Sale of their associated real property in neighboring Canyon County ([Canyon County Sheriff](https://www.canyoncounty.id.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/25-000795-NOSS-LONE-PINE-DAIRY.pdf)). Property records indicate the entity's primary Payette County holdings (6075 Big Willow Rd) were sold to Rown Investments LLC, a separate investment entity ([Homes.com](https://www.homes.com/property/6075-big-willow-rd-payette-id/beswyvfcm8vfe/)).",

## Thought 1

**Starting Neighbor Profile Verification**

I am initiating the research process to verify the four identified neighbor profiles—Westech Components Inc, 19 Acres LLC, Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC, and the City of Peoria—in Maricopa County, Arizona, for the renewable energy development project. My primary focus is establishing the confirmed identity, entity classification, and ownership relevance for each organization.

---

## Thought 2



**Focusing on Business and Municipal Entities**

For the corporate entities (Westech, 19 Acres, Caretaker West), I plan to use business registration and land records to confirm their legal standing and relevance in Maricopa County. For the City of Peoria, I will look for official documents like their General Plan or renewable energy policies to understand their official development posture, which is crucial for assessing their influence.

---

## Thought 3



**Action Plan for Initial Data Gathering**

My immediate actions involve a focused batch of searches for all four entities. I will look for official corporate commission records for the LLCs, potential connections to related organizations (like Younger Brothers for Westech and Westland Properties for Caretaker), and the general planning stance of the City of Peoria. This will provide the necessary foundational information before investigating specific stances or influence.

---

## Thought 4



**Verifying Neighboring Entities**

I am synthesizing the initial search results focused on identifying and verifying the neighbors of the proposed project site. I confirmed that 'Westech' is likely part of 'Younger Brothers Companies,' operating as 'Westech Lumber LLC' at the specified location in Peoria. This potentially contradicts the initial profile name of 'Westech Components Inc.', so I am prioritizing a search to clarify the exact legal entity associated with that address.

---

## Thought 5



**Identifying Land Owners**

A critical next step is confirming the ownership of parcels associated with '19 Acres LLC' and 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC'. Direct entity searches did not immediately yield definitive results, so I am focusing on using the specific parcel identification numbers (PINs) within the Maricopa County Assessor records. This is the most reliable path to determine current ownership and the official legal names of these holding companies.

---

## Thought 6



**City of Peoria Stance**

The search confirmed that the City of Peoria's official stance, as reflected in its General Plan and recent actions, is supportive of sustainability, energy efficiency, and economic development. I've noted past examples of citizen opposition to *other* large projects, suggesting that while the city government is supportive, public scrutiny remains a relevant factor. This information is sufficient to characterize the City's influence.

---

## Thought 7



**Action Plan: Deep Dive with PINs**

My immediate plan involves performing targeted searches using the specific parcel identification numbers to resolve ownership ambiguities for Westech, 19 Acres LLC, and Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC. I will also make precise searches in the Arizona Corporation Commission records to solidify the legal names and affiliations for the surrounding entities.

---

## Thought 8



**Uncovering Entity Ownership**

Synthesizing the initial search results, I've confirmed the existence of '19 Acres LLC' in Arizona. However, identifying the true beneficial owner or manager remains an information gap. Similarly, for 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC', a snippet suggests 'Mary A Wall' is the Member and Manager, but I need to confirm this linkage and rule out any connection to the larger 'Caretaker Landscape' organization.

---

## Thought 9



**Resolving Name Discrepancy**

A potential contradiction has emerged regarding the 'Westech' entity. The initial search pointed towards 'Westech Lumber LLC', while the project brief referenced 'Westech Components Inc'. I need to perform targeted searches to verify which legal entity operates at the specific address, allowing me to proceed with the correct subject name for subsequent research.

---

## Thought 10



**Next Steps: Deepening Corporate and Land Records**

My next phase of research will focus on accessing (via targeted searches) the Arizona Corporation Commission data to definitively confirm the principal members of both '19 Acres LLC' and 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC'. Simultaneously, I will search specific parcel numbers and addresses to confirm the ownership status for the City of Peoria and to finalize the correct 'Westech' entity name. This targeted approach is designed to close the identified information gaps rapidly.

---

## Thought 11



**Uncovering Key Individuals**

Synthesizing the recent business registration data has yielded new, actionable intelligence. I have successfully identified the key individuals associated with the holding companies: **Nicolas Tran** is the member of '19 Acres LLC,' and **Mary A Wall** is the member and manager of 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC.' This shifts the focus from purely corporate identities to investigating the influence and development history of these specific individuals.

---

## Thought 12



**Resolving Westech Entity Confusion**

I am close to resolving the specific entity operating at the neighboring parcel, which was initially named 'Westech Components Inc.' Evidence strongly suggests the operating entity is 'Westech Lumber LLC,' which is tied to the 'Younger Brothers Development' group. I noted that the initial profile draft acknowledges that 'Westech Components Inc' operates the business under the 'Westech Lumber LLC' DBA. My next step is to confirm the exact parcel owner using assessor records, which is critical to determine which entity will be the primary contact.

---

## Thought 13



**Investigating Caretaker Connection**

The name 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel, LLC' is highly distinctive and shares a core name with the known entity 'Caretaker Landscape.' I recognize the possibility of a link, perhaps through an ownership group or related real estate investment, though the member is identified as Mary A Wall, while Caretaker Landscape is owned by Matt White. My immediate goal is to search for connections between Mary A Wall and the 'Caretaker' group or broader Peoria real estate development to ascertain her role and potential influence.

---

## Thought 14



**Targeted Searches for Individuals and Owners**

I am generating a new set of focused searches to investigate the backgrounds of the newly identified principals, Nicolas Tran and Mary A Wall, specifically targeting their involvement in Peoria real estate or development projects. I will also perform a final search to definitively confirm the parcel owner for the Westech/Younger Brothers property.

---

## Thought 15



**Clarifying Business Identity**

I have successfully resolved the name ambiguity for the 'Westech' entity. The evidence strongly suggests that the entity occupying the address is 'Younger Brothers Development,' which operates 'Westech Lumber' (or a similar brand), confirming the business nature is construction supply. The initial profile name, 'Westech Components Inc.,' appears to be inaccurate or refers to a different entity entirely. I will proceed with the updated, verified information regarding Younger Brothers Development.

---

## Thought 16



**Identifying Real Estate Investor**

I have confirmed that '19 Acres LLC' is associated with Nicolas Tran, who is also linked to 'Three E Real Estate LLC.' This solidifies the classification of '19 Acres LLC' as a real estate holding or speculative investment vehicle, providing sufficient context for assessing its likely stance in the project's vicinity.

---

## Thought 17



**Resolving Holding Company Ownership**

A significant information gap remains regarding the true owner of 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC.' While a snippet referenced 'Mary A Wall,' I cannot definitively confirm her role or if the LLC is connected to the widely recognized 'Caretaker Landscape' organization owned by Matt White, given the similarity in names. It is also important to verify the draft's mention of a link to 'Westland Properties.' I need to focus my next searches on finding the specific address and manager of this entity to confirm its status as a simple real estate holding company.

---

## Thought 18



**Next Steps: Confirming Caretaker Details**

My immediate plan is to execute a final batch of highly specific searches to pinpoint the address and definitive manager of 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC.' This will involve searching for linkages between the LLC name, potential owners (like Matt White or Mary Wall), and the alleged connection to 'Westland Properties' to close the last remaining gap in the neighbor profiles.

---

## Thought 19



**Verifying Caretaker LLC’s Purpose**

I am synthesizing the information regarding 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC.' Although I have identified Mary A Wall as the member/manager, the name strongly suggests a connection to 'Caretaker Landscape,' likely as a land holding or investment vehicle. I successfully located the physical address for Caretaker Landscape's Peoria location, which adds weight to this theory. The next step is to solidify this connection through real estate records and confirm if Mary A Wall is acting as a representative or is the beneficial owner.

---

## Thought 20



**Closing Information Gaps**

I have successfully resolved the primary ownership details for three of the four neighbors: '19 Acres LLC' (Nicolas Tran), 'Westech' (Younger Brothers/Westech Lumber), and the 'City of Peoria.' The final critical remaining gap is confirming the context and activity of the principal for Caretaker LLC, Mary A Wall, and clarifying any potential involvement of Westland Properties, which was referenced in the initial project draft but not explicitly linked in the search results.

---

## Thought 21



**Action Plan: Final Ownership Context**

My immediate plan is to execute a final batch of highly specific searches designed to connect the dots: linking 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC' with 'Mary A Wall' and potential real estate brokers like 'Westland Properties,' and confirming whether the name 'Caretaker' in the LLC title is purely coincidental or indicates a formal relationship with 'Caretaker Landscape' or its owners. This will finalize the ownership context before moving on to influence analysis.

---

## Thought 22



**Finalizing Entity Profiles**

I have successfully gathered all necessary information to finalize the profiles for the four neighboring entities: Westech Lumber (Younger Brothers Development), 19 Acres LLC (Nicolas Tran), Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC (Mary A. Wall), and the City of Peoria. The key individuals and corporate affiliations have been identified, and I have confirmed their roles as either industrial/commercial operator, real estate holding company, or municipal entity.

---

## Thought 23



**Confirming Parcel Ownership**

I have cross-referenced the entity names with their specific Parcel Identification Numbers (PINs) in Maricopa County, confirming the exact land ownership. The PIN 14321007A aligns with Westech Lumber. The 19 Acres LLC and Caretaker entities are also tied to their respective PINs, providing a definitive map of ownership around the project site.

---

## Thought 24



**Moving to Profile Generation**

Having resolved all major ambiguities, including the 'Westech' name discrepancy, the ownership of the LLCs (Tran and Wall), and the status of the City of Peoria, I have reached a point of saturation. All fields necessary for the comprehensive neighbor profile analysis can now be filled. My next action is to synthesize this complete dataset into the final structured output.

---

## Thought 25

**Verifying Neighbor Identities and Ownership**

I am initiating the research to verify four specific neighbor profiles for a renewable energy development. My immediate focus is on resolving potential identity confusion for 'Westech Components Inc' versus 'Westech Lumber', confirming the ownership structure for '19 Acres LLC' and 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC' using official records, and establishing the general land use for the 'City of Peoria'.

---

## Thought 26



**Investigating Stances and Activities**

Concurrently, I am gathering information on the potential stance of the City of Peoria regarding renewable energy, given the mention of the Sustainable Peoria Plan and an Ameresco partnership in the draft profile. I also need to find any public activity or stance related to development for the commercial and LLC entities, such as 'Westech Lumber' and 'Caretaker Landscape'.

---

## Thought 27



**Action Plan: Authoritative Search**

The next step is to execute a set of targeted searches focusing on obtaining authoritative sources, like the Arizona Corporation Commission (AZCC) records, to confirm legal entity details and ownership, alongside searches for public documents outlining the City of Peoria's sustainability efforts. I have formulated five distinct search queries to tackle these verification points efficiently.

---

## Thought 28



**Verifying Entity Names and Addresses**

I am working on resolving an ambiguity regarding the "Westech" entity in Peoria. Initial information suggests the entity at the given address is likely "Westech Lumber LLC" (a division of Younger Brothers Companies), but I need to confirm this correction against a potentially separate entity named "Westech Components Inc." (possibly related to electronics recycling in Glendale). My next steps are focused on searching for specific addresses to definitively differentiate these two entities.

---

## Thought 29



**Confirming Stakeholders and Holding Companies**

For the entity "19 Acres LLC," I've successfully confirmed the connection to Nicolas Tran and Maricopa County, which validates the existing profile information. This entity appears to be a holding company, supporting an 'unknown' stance regarding its environmental activity. I will conduct a final check to ensure the associated entities like "Azspecialtea Lc" are not environmentally relevant before moving on.

---

## Thought 30



**Investigating Caretaker and Wall Connection**

I still need to solidify the link between "Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC" and its associated stakeholder, Mary A. Wall. The previous searches were inconclusive on her specific role or whether she is connected to the wider 'Caretaker Landscape' organization. I am planning a targeted search to confirm her connection to the LLC and to establish any relationship with the landscaping company to fully inform the profile.

---

## Thought 31



**Pinpointing City of Peoria's Solar Partners**

While I found strong evidence of the City of Peoria's commitment to sustainability through the 'Sustainable Peoria Plan' and high solar rankings, and older projects involving Tessera Solar and Salt River Project, the profile mentions a partnership with 'Ameresco'. I did not find confirmation of Ameresco in the initial snippets. To ensure accuracy, I will execute a specific search to verify the Ameresco claim, or otherwise use the well-supported 'Salt River/Tessera' project details and the current Sustainable Plan to justify the 'support' stance.

---

## Thought 32



**Refining Entity Information**

I've successfully synthesized the initial search results to refine the identity of one of the major commercial neighbors. 'Westech Components' appears to be an incorrect name; the correct entity associated with the parcel is 'Westech Lumber LLC', which is co-located with or associated with Younger Brothers Co. This distinction is crucial for understanding the site's commercial context. The partnership between the City of Peoria and Ameresco regarding solar covered parking has also been confirmed, strongly supporting the City's proactive stance on renewable energy.

---

## Thought 33



**Addressing Ownership Ambiguities**

A significant information gap remains regarding the ownership of 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC'. The initial snippet linking the LLC to 'Mary A. Wall' was highly ambiguous, potentially confusing 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel, LLC' with another entity, 'O Side Getaway LLC', in a list format. I must specifically verify the membership of the Caretaker LLC to confirm or reject its potential link to 'Caretaker Landscape', which would drastically alter the analysis of that neighbor's influence.

---

## Thought 34



**Investigating Neighbor Activity**

To further classify the potential stance of the commercial neighbors, I need to investigate the business activities of Younger Brothers Construction, which is linked to Westech Lumber. By searching for their involvement in solar or renewable energy construction projects, I can better assess whether they might be a proponent or opponent of development. I will also perform a quick check on '19 Acres LLC' regarding any known zoning activities, in case any public record exists.

---

## Thought 35



**Targeted Verification Actions**

My next actions will focus on resolving these ambiguities through targeted investigations: a deep dive into the 'Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC' ownership records, and specific searches regarding Younger Brothers' involvement in renewable energy construction, to gather solid evidence regarding their likely stance.

---

## Thought 36



**Finalizing Entity Research**

I am in the final stages of verifying all neighbor profiles. I have successfully resolved several ambiguities regarding the Westech entities and confirmed the stakeholders for 19 Acres LLC. The main focus now is a high-confidence verification of the remaining relationships and specific activities before concluding the research phase.

---

## Thought 37



**Investigating Caretaker and Mary A. Wall Relationship**

A key detail requiring high confidence is the connection between the stakeholder Mary A. Wall and the entity Caretaker West Peoria Parcel LLC, as well as a potential link to the broader Caretaker Landscape organization. To ensure I have not missed a family or business connection, I will conduct a highly specific search linking her name directly to 'Caretaker Landscape.' This is essential for providing a complete and accurate organizational context for the LLC.

---

## Thought 38



**Verifying Citations and Next Actions**

Once the final research queries are executed, I will verify that I have the correct and complete URLs for all necessary citations. My immediate action plan is to execute two highly targeted searches: one to confirm the connection between 'Mary A Wall' and 'Caretaker Landscape,' and another to confirm any public activity or stance related to 'Nicolas Tran' and '19 Acres'. This will ensure the final profile synthesis is based on fully vetted information.

## Thought 1

**Local Stakeholder Mapping**

I have identified three key individuals—Jeffrey Boyce, Brice Johnson, and Ellen Hersee—who reside in the Town of Alabama within Genesee County. Based on the preliminary data, they appear to be neighbors linked to specific tax map identifiers. I am prioritizing the verification of their identities and land ownership status to ensure the research profiles are grounded in accurate geographic data.

---

## Thought 2



**Contextual Gaps and Sentiment**

A significant objective is to move beyond generic citations and find specific evidence of these individuals' perspectives on local energy developments. I am looking for mentions of their names in municipal records or community news to determine if they have voiced support or opposition. Additionally, I need to clarify if any of them hold influential positions on local boards or within the farming community, as this would define their level of impact on the project.

---

## Thought 3



**Investigative Strategy**

I am proceeding by synthesizing information from regional property assessment rolls and public meeting minutes. This involves cross-referencing names with local government archives and news reports to build a comprehensive view of their local influence and specific claims. My next steps will focus on extracting these details to refine each profile and provide validated, specific citations for their stances.

---

## Thought 4



**Geographic Clarifications**

While synthesizing local meeting records from Genesee County, I've identified a specific listing for Brice Johnson within an agricultural protection document. A key insight is that these records associate the property with the town of Elba rather than Alabama, which contradicts the initial location details I was working with. I also noticed that these listings appear in proximity to documentation for the Cider Solar project, providing a potential link between these landowners and large-scale energy developments in the region.

---

## Thought 5



**Resolving Parcel Discrepancies**

I am currently resolving a conflict between the parcel identification numbers provided in my initial data and those found in official county documents. Because the towns of Elba and Alabama are adjacent, I am investigating whether the individuals in question hold land in both jurisdictions or if the records simply point to a correction in the primary location. Establishing this geographic accuracy is essential for tracking down the specific assessment rolls and land use stances for Jeffrey Boyce and Ellen Hersee, who have not yet appeared in the broader county summaries.

---

## Thought 6



**Verifying Ownership and Context**

My next steps involve cross-referencing the specific tax map IDs with municipal assessment rolls to confirm exactly where these holdings lie. I plan to look deeper into the historical records of the local agricultural board to see if Jeffrey Boyce or Ellen Hersee have voiced specific positions on land preservation or solar leasing. By connecting these names to specific project footprints like the Cider Solar initiative, I aim to clarify their roles and perspectives within the local community.

---

## Thought 7



**Identifying Landowner Roles**

I have pinpointed the exact locations and parcel identifiers for key stakeholders, confirming their primary involvement in the Town of Elba. By synthesizing local meeting packets and project-specific land indices, I found that Jeffrey Boyce and Brice Johnson are explicitly listed as involved landowners within the agricultural district reviews for the Cider Solar project. Specifically, I have identified that Johnson manages over 124 acres, which clarifies his potential significance within the local farming community and the project's footprint.

---

## Thought 8



**Clarifying Ownership Discrepancies**

I am currently resolving a contradiction regarding property ownership for a parcel previously attributed to Ellen Hersee. Recent municipal records from late 2024 suggest this specific map identifier is now associated with a different individual in a neighboring town. I am thinking through whether this indicates a recent property transfer or a geographic error in the initial data. Additionally, I am distinguishing between local agricultural stakeholders and professionals with similar names in regional research foundations to ensure the profiles are accurately grounded in local community dynamics.

---

## Thought 9



**Investigating Public Records**

My next move is to conduct a targeted search for specific public hearing contributions within official project dockets and meeting minutes. I aim to uncover whether these individuals have formally expressed support or concerns during the regulatory review process, moving beyond their status as parcel owners. I will also focus on tracing the recent history of the disputed property to confirm the current status of Ellen Hersee and her connection to the local area.

---

## Thought 10



**Confirmed Support and Participation**

I have successfully verified that Brice Johnson is an active supporter of the Cider Solar development. My analysis of recent legal records confirms he signed a 20-year lease agreement with the project developers in early 2023. Additionally, I have corrected the geographic data for Jeffrey Boyce; like Johnson, his land is located in the town of Elba rather than Alabama. While Boyce appears in the project's land-use plans, I am still evaluating whether he is a direct participant or an adjacent landowner, which is crucial for determining his personal stake in the project.

---

## Thought 11



**Resolving Identity and Ownership Conflicts**

I am currently investigating a significant contradiction regarding Ellen Hersee. The property identifier previously linked to her appears to be associated with a different individual in a neighboring town, raising the possibility that the initial data is outdated or refers to a former owner. I am now cross-referencing regional estate records and historic property filings to determine if she still holds land in the county or if the property has since been sold.

---

## Thought 12



**Evaluating Influence and Status**

My next phase of research involves synthesizing community news archives and agricultural records to clarify the professional backgrounds and local influence of these individuals. I am focusing on uncovering specific details regarding their roles in the community, such as involvement in farming organizations or local boards. This will allow me to finalize each profile with a clear understanding of their stances and the weight of their perspectives on regional land-use developments.

---

## Thought 13



**Confirming Stakeholder Engagement**

I have successfully confirmed that Brice Johnson is an active supporter of local energy developments, having officially executed a lease agreement in early 2023 involving over 124 acres of agricultural land. Conversely, I’ve determined that Jeffrey Boyce is a non-participating neighbor within the project vicinity. While his land falls within the study area, he is not currently listed as a leaseholder, which helps clarify the varying degrees of involvement and influence among these property owners.

---

## Thought 14



**Resolving Data Conflicts**

I am currently investigating a significant discrepancy regarding Ellen Hersee. While initial data linked her to a specific property identifier in the Town of Alabama, recent records indicate that this parcel code is actually located in Darien and held by a different owner. I am thinking through whether this stems from a geographic misclassification in the original records or if the stakeholder in question owns land elsewhere in the county that has yet to be identified in the primary project documents.

---

## Thought 15



**Targeted Record Search**

My next phase of research will focus on locating Ellen Hersee by performing a more granular scan of municipal tax maps and agricultural records across several neighboring jurisdictions. I will also examine specific project dockets to see if her name appears in any public commentary or correspondence, which will help determine her actual standing and perspective within the local community.

---

## Thought 16



**Local Surname Connections**

I have identified a new lead by locating a related individual in the 2025 regional assessment rolls, which confirms that the surname in question is established within the project’s immediate vicinity. This finding suggests that my investigation should focus on specific townships near the development site, as the family name appears in municipal records linked to the local school district and surrounding agricultural lands.

---

## Thought 17



**Resolving Geographic Misalignments**

A key insight from my synthesis is that property identifiers are unique to individual towns rather than being county-wide. I realized that a previous identification of a different owner was likely a 'red herring' caused by looking at a different municipality. I am now correcting this by narrowing my focus to the specific jurisdictions where the energy project is actually located, which should resolve the contradiction between the provided draft information and the current land records.

---

## Thought 18



**Refining Landowner Identification**

I am thinking through the possibility that the name provided in the initial data is associated with a specific parcel within the project area that hasn't been fully detailed in broader summaries. My next steps involve looking deeper into the land registries for these specific townships to verify the owner of the identified parcel and determine if the individual has been mentioned in recent project-specific documentation or local land-use agreements.

---

## Thought 19



**Tracing Stakeholder Records**

I have successfully tracked records for Ellen Hersee to the town of Oakfield, providing a breakthrough that contradicts the initial location data. By synthesizing details from regional public records, I’ve determined that the property identifier previously linked to her actually belongs to a different individual in the town of Alabama. This indicates that the original data likely conflated her name with a parcel number from an adjacent jurisdiction, and I am now focusing on this new geographic lead to verify her actual holdings.

---

## Thought 20



**Untangling Parcel Conflicts**

I am currently resolving a complex discrepancy where a single identification number appears to be associated with different owners across three separate towns. My investigation has identified specific individuals—one in Alabama and another in Darien—who are the actual owners of the land previously attributed to Hersee. This finding clarifies why past searches were yielding conflicting results and confirms that her profile requires a complete re-mapping of her geographic and residential status to ensure accuracy.

---

## Thought 21



**Refining Local Profiles**

My next phase of research involves a targeted investigation into the town of Oakfield’s assessment rolls to locate the correct land assets for this resident. I will also re-examine project-specific documents for her name to determine if she has voiced any formal positions on regional land-use changes. Simultaneously, I am thinking through the classification of other identified stakeholders to distinguish between large-scale agricultural operations and smaller residential properties, ensuring their community influence is accurately characterized.

---

## Thought 22



**Distinguishing Landowner Participation**

I have clarified the specific nature of involvement for the remaining stakeholders by synthesizing recent agricultural district records and project-specific land summaries. I’ve confirmed that while one individual is a definitive supporter due to an active long-term lease, another is strictly a neighboring property owner with no recorded public stance. This verification is essential for accurately characterizing the local influence and the varied interests of those living near the project site.

---

## Thought 23



**Correcting Ownership Inaccuracies**

I have successfully resolved a significant data conflict regarding property records in the Town of Alabama. By cross-referencing current municipal tax rolls, I determined that a parcel identifier previously attributed to a specific stakeholder is actually registered to a different individual. This finding allows me to correct the geographic errors in the initial data and ensures that the final profiles reflect verified land ownership rather than outdated or misaligned records.

---

## Thought 24



**Finalizing Stakeholder Profiles**

I am now moving to finalize the research findings by integrating these verified ownership details and the confirmed public stances. My next steps involve documenting the specific evidence—or lack thereof—regarding public hearing contributions to justify the neutral status of certain individuals. I will focus on synthesizing all gathered records into a final report that highlights the accurate geographic and professional standing of each community member.

---

## Thought 25

**Discrepancies in Location and Ownership**

I am currently evaluating the geographical placement and ownership records for several individuals in Genesee County, specifically looking at property sections in the towns of Alabama and Elba. I've noted a potential conflict regarding whether certain parcels belong to the listed individuals or different owners entirely; for instance, one property attributed to a specific neighbor in the initial data may actually belong to another party, requiring a deeper look into official tax records.

---

## Thought 26



**Connections to Local Energy Projects**

I am investigating specific ties to regional infrastructure developments, including reports of existing lease agreements with energy companies involved in local solar initiatives. Identifying these relationships is crucial for understanding the landscape of local influence and potential financial interests, particularly as they relate to specific land use agreements and public participation in development projects.

---

## Thought 27



**Investigating Public Records and Tax Data**

My next steps involve synthesizing information from official tax assessment rolls and public meeting transcripts to resolve ownership contradictions. I will be analyzing agricultural district reviews and public hearing documentation to verify if these individuals have voiced specific stances and to confirm that their property status aligns with official county records.

---

## Thought 28



**Resolving Geographic Discrepancies**

I have identified a geographic mismatch where a parcel previously associated with the Town of Alabama is actually situated in the Town of Elba. Correcting this location is vital for accurately mapping the individual's local influence and ensuring the research reflects the correct municipal jurisdiction.

---

## Thought 29



**Investigating Ownership Conflicts**

I've uncovered a contradiction regarding property ownership for a key site; while official assessment rolls list one owner, project-related documents point to a different individual. I am thinking through whether this indicates a family relationship, a recent transfer of rights, or an error in the project's preliminary documentation.

---

## Thought 30



**Verifying Project Participation**

To resolve these inconsistencies, I am synthesizing information from regional land agreement summaries and property records. My next steps involve clarifying the connection between these individuals and the solar development to ensure that their stances and property associations are precisely documented.

---

## Thought 31



**Geographic and Ownership Clarification**

I have successfully narrowed down the residency for one individual, determining that their property is located in Elba rather than Alabama. While I encountered a namesake involved in academic research, I have cross-referenced local tax rolls to confirm the correct subject. This correction allows me to better align the research with specific municipal jurisdictions and local project boundaries.

---

## Thought 32



**Verifying Agreement Participation**

A significant gap remains regarding whether specific individuals have formal ties to regional energy projects through signed land agreements. I am investigating reports of a specific lease summary document to determine if names appearing on tax maps represent the primary contacts or if family members are the authorized signatories. Additionally, I am seeking to verify the existence of a resident in Oakfield who has not yet appeared in standard property record searches.

---

## Thought 33



**Next Steps for Document Review**

My next phase of work involves retrieving and analyzing specific land agreement summaries and project filings related to local solar developments. I will be conducting targeted searches for these regulatory documents and searching for local residency records to confirm identities and public stances that have not yet been established through general records.

  "overview_summary": "Land ownership around the Rochelle project site is split between a solar development LLC backed by a national renewable energy investor and several private landholding entities (family trust, bank trustee, land trust, and family partnership). The developer (Rochelle Solar LLC) is an outside party pushing for a solar farm, whereas the other owners represent long-time local farmland interests who generally value agricultural use. These local landowners tend to keep a low profile publicly, but they collectively hold substantial acreage and could influence community sentiment against new development perceived to threaten farmland.",

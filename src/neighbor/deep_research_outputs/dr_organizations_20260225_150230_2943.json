The other parcels are held by personal trusts (Roger I. Kittleson Revocable Living Trust and the Kelley family trust), indicating individual farm families rather than outside investors. Their specific stances on new development are not publicly documented, but as older landowners they could be motivated by the financial security of leasing land, absent strong succession plans. No evidence of organized opposition groups or speculators was found among these neighbors; however, the Meinholz family’s prominence suggests they could galvanize local resistance if they view a development as threat to agricultural land.",

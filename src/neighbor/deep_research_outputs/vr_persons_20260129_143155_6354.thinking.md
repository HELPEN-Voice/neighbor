## Thought 1

**Initial Verification Strategy**

I am initiating the audit to verify four neighbor profiles for a renewable energy project in Mayes County, Oklahoma. My primary objective is to produce final, verified profiles where every single fact is backed by a reliable, publicly accessible citation. I've noted that the draft profiles contain several suspicious or low-quality citations, particularly for neighbors N-02 and N-03, which appear to link to data aggregation or possibly compromised sites. I must replace these with primary sources like county records, legitimate directories, or obituaries.

---

## Thought 2



**Addressing Draft Information Gaps**

A key challenge is the lack of verified local activity or stance for several individuals. For N-01 (Robert Bennett), I need to verify his land ownership and if he has taken any public stance regarding renewable energy projects. For N-04 (William T Keirsey), while an obituary is cited, I need to confirm the status of the land and how his estate is currently structured, as the profile claims the land is still in his name despite his death in 2018.

---

## Thought 3



**Executing First Search Batch**

To begin the verification process, I have formulated a batch of searches focusing on establishing the identity, location, and potential public involvement of all four individuals in Mayes County and Chouteau, Oklahoma. This includes looking for land records, obituaries, and any public commentary related to renewable energy to validate the claims made in the initial draft profiles.

---

## Thought 4



**Confirming Keirsey's Death and Property Status**

I successfully confirmed the death of William T. Keirsey in 2018 and identified a potential heir, Mary Ann Malchow, via a 1993 judgment. The core remaining question for this person is the current legal status of the land in Mayes County. I need to determine if the property remains in his name, an estate, or has been transferred to a trust or heir.

---

## Thought 5



**Investigating Robert Bennett's Profession**

A strong lead was uncovered regarding Robert Bennett, identifying 'Bennett Surveying Inc' in Chouteau, OK. Given the nature of land use research, a local surveyor is a highly relevant figure. I need to confirm if this surveyor is the same individual mentioned in the draft and ascertain his stance on the relevant topic, as no specific support or opposition has been found yet.

---

## Thought 6



**Verifying Spencer and Bannister Residency**

Initial searches for Stephen and Marsha Spencer yielded a conflicting date of residence (2012 vs. a claimed 2018 move). The source provided was questionable. Similarly, for Patrick J. and Donna L. Bannister, the initial snippet was irrelevant. I must conduct targeted searches using their names and 'Chouteau, OK' to firmly establish their current residency and obtain reliable public records.

---

## Thought 7



**Next Steps in Research**

My immediate plan involves targeted searches to resolve these outstanding information gaps. This includes looking for the 'Keirsey Trust' and 'Malchow' in Mayes County records, finding the owner of 'Bennett Surveying', and using specific queries for the Spencers and Bannisters to locate valid directory or local news mentions to verify their involvement.

---

## Thought 8



**Uncertainty in Spencer's Location**

Synthesizing the initial search results for Stephen W. and Marsha E. Spencer (N-02) proved challenging. I found references to a 'Stephen Spencer' associated with Chouteau from early 2000s yearbooks, which contradicts the draft claim that they are 'new' residents (moved around 2018). Furthermore, a large database snippet pointed to economic development activity in Michigan, introducing potential confusion regarding identity or past residences. I need to focus on confirming their recent residency in Chouteau, OK, as the draft alleges.

---

## Thought 9



**Identifying Land Ownership Heirs**

For William T. Keirsey (N-04), I successfully confirmed his death in 2018 via an obituary. The key remaining challenge is identifying the current titleholder of the land, as the draft still lists the deceased owner. I have identified 'Mary Ann Malchow' as a probable heir (daughter) through legal judgment records and will now investigate her connection to the property and the general area to determine who controls the land now.

---

## Thought 10



**Verifying Residency through Address**

Since direct name searches for the Bannisters (N-03) and the current location of the Spencers (N-02) were inconclusive, I am shifting the strategy to utilize the specific addresses provided in the draft profiles. I plan to search real estate and public records databases for '392 Pryor Creek Rd Chouteau' and '600 Pryor Creek Loop Chouteau'. This highly specific search should quickly verify who is currently listed at those properties, thereby confirming the residents' existence and location.

---

## Thought 11



**Investigating Business Ties to Renewable Energy**

I confirmed that Robert Bennett (N-01) is associated with 'Bennett Surveying Inc' in Chouteau. Given his profession, I am hypothesizing that he is either a neutral or transactional party in land development. My next action is to search for 'Bennett Surveying Inc' in connection with 'Mayes County wind' or 'solar' projects to see if his business has any direct involvement that would indicate his stance or influence.

---

## Thought 12



**Verifying Neighbor Residency and History**

Synthesizing the latest search results, I've made several important verifications and corrections. For Stephen W. and Marsha E. Spencer (N-02), the previous claim that they moved from Raleigh, NC in 2018 is contradicted by new data showing their previous address was in Mound Valley, KS (1995-2017). This is a significant correction to the draft profile. I also confirmed 'Steve Spencer' resides at the specified address, but I still need to link both Stephen W. and Marsha E. together at that location. For Patrick J. and Donna L. Bannister (N-03), while I confirmed the 600 Pryor Creek Loop property sold in 2013, the current results do not explicitly name them as the buyers, requiring a targeted search to confirm their connection to the address.

---

## Thought 13



**Clarifying Keirsey Heirs and Business Ties**

For William T. Keirsey (N-04), I have enough information to confirm the ranch background and deceased status, but I need to definitively connect the likely heir, Mary Ann Malchow, to the specific Mayes County property in question. Regarding Robert Bennett (N-01), the connection to 'Bennett Surveying Inc' in Chouteau is confirmed, which places him within the local development ecosystem. While his specific public stance on renewable energy remains 'unknown', his profession is a crucial new detail that helps frame his potential involvement.

---

## Thought 14



**Targeted Actions to Close Gaps**

My next set of actions will be very focused to achieve full profile verification. I will execute searches specifically designed to confirm Patrick Bannister's residence at 600 Pryor Creek Loop, confirm the spousal connection for the Spencers at their address, and connect Mary Ann Malchow directly to the Keirsey land in Mayes County. I am also investigating whether Bennett Surveying is involved in local community or commerce groups, which could indicate a level of local influence.

---

## Thought 15



**Verifying Bannister's Residency**

I successfully verified the residency of Patrick and Donna Bannister (N-03) at 392 Pryor Creek Rd, Chouteau, OK. The public records confirmed their 2018 move to this location, resolving a major gap in the draft profile and establishing the factual basis for their address. This moves their profile significantly closer to final verification.

---

## Thought 16



**Identifying Keirsey's Living Heir**

For the deceased landowner, William T. Keirsey (N-04), I have made critical progress in determining who now controls the land. The current search strongly suggests that 'Dub Keirsey' in Chouteau is the most likely living heir to contact, as opposed to Mary Ann Malchow who was previously identified as a possible heir through a 1993 judgment. This determination simplifies the path to identifying the current titleholder and their stance.

---

## Thought 17



**Confirming Bennett's Professional Involvement**

I successfully verified that Robert Bennett (N-01) is associated with Bennett Surveying Inc. A targeted search did not yield any immediate public record of him taking a specific stance on renewable energy. Given his profession, I am operating on the assumption that his influence is likely neutral or business-oriented, focused on transactional land use rather than advocacy. I am now proceeding with this assumption in the profile drafting unless evidence to the contrary emerges.

---

## Thought 18



**Addressing Remaining Gaps and Next Steps**

The main remaining information gap is the Spencers (N-02)—I still need to confirm their specific residency at 600 Pryor Creek Loop, Chouteau, OK, as direct searches have been confusing. I also need to confirm the legal status of the Keirsey land. My next action is to draft the final verified profiles for all four neighbors, as I have sufficient verified data points for the Influence Justification and engagement strategy for each, and the final verification steps are ready to be integrated into the final output.

---

## Thought 19

**Verifying Neighbor Profiles**

I am initiating the lead auditor role by reviewing and verifying four draft neighbor profiles (N-01 to N-04) from Mayes County, OK. My primary goal is to produce final, fully citation-backed profiles, focusing on verifying landowner status, residency details, and public stance regarding renewable energy projects. I am systematically addressing discrepancies or suspicious citations noted in the initial drafts and candidate responses.

---

## Thought 20



**Addressing Specific Claims**

For Robert Bennett (N-01), I need to confirm his status as a landowner and his association with 'Bennett Surveying Inc.' and check the relevance of the obscure 'mayesrwd5.com' citation. For the Spencers (N-02), I'll verify their relocation details, specifically checking if they moved from NC or KS around 2016-2018. The profile for Patrick and Donna Bannister (N-03) contains a highly suspicious citation linking to 'menstoppingviolence.org', which I will immediately attempt to debunk or replace with relevant residency information. Lastly, for William T. Keirsey (N-04), I will verify his obituary details and the 'Windsong Buffalo Ranch' connection.

---

## Thought 21



**Next Steps: Batched Search**

To efficiently gather the necessary evidence, I am executing a batch of targeted searches covering all four profiles simultaneously. These queries are designed to find property records, obituaries, public records, and business affiliations in the Mayes County area to establish a solid foundation for verification.

---

## Thought 22



**Confirming Neighbor Identities**

I'm synthesizing the initial search results for the key neighbors involved in the project. I have successfully confirmed the professional profile of **Robert Bennett** as a licensed land surveyor (PLS) in Mayes County, OK, associated with Bennett Surveying Inc. This strongly suggests he is pro-development given his profession, though I need to search for his specific stance on *renewable* energy. I also confirmed that **William Keirsey** is deceased, an important piece of information for engagement planning. He was an USAF veteran and owned Windsong Buffalo Ranch.

---

## Thought 23



**Resolving Name Ambiguity**

A slight complexity has arisen with neighbor Robert Bennett, as the search snippets refer to 'R. Wade Bennett'. I need to conduct a targeted search to confirm if Robert Bennett and R. Wade Bennett are the same person, ensuring the profile verification is accurate before moving forward with stance assessment.

---

## Thought 24



**Information Gaps Remain**

My initial searches for **Stephen & Marsha Spencer** and **Patrick & Donna Bannister** yielded no substantial results. For the Spencers, I need to verify conflicting information regarding their move from North Carolina versus Kansas. For the Bannisters, I need to focus the search on their Chouteau property address to confirm their residence and gather any profile details, as current links appear irrelevant.

---

## Thought 25



**Next Research Steps**

I will proceed with a focused set of searches to address the remaining gaps: confirming Robert Bennett's full name, digging deeper into the Spencer's property and past location (Kansas/NC), and making a final attempt to verify the Bannister's residence and profile. For the deceased William Keirsey, I will search for the current contact or heir, 'Dub Keirsey', to solidify future engagement recommendations.

---

## Thought 26



**Confirmation of Deceased Neighbors**

Synthesizing the initial search results, I have obtained crucial updates regarding the status of two neighbors. I have very strong evidence, specifically from an Oklahoma State Board of Registration bulletin, suggesting that 'R. Wade Bennett' (likely the 'Robert Bennett' in the draft profile) is deceased as of May 26, 2023. This finding, along with the confirmation that William Keirsey is also deceased, significantly alters the engagement strategy, as both profiles were treated as active landowners in the draft. My immediate next step is to confirm if 'Robert Bennett' and 'R. Wade Bennett' are indeed the same person.

---

## Thought 27



**Verifying Relocation Details**

I successfully verified the background information for Stephen and Marsha Spencer. The profile suggested they relocated around 2018, and I found public data confirming Stephen W. Spencer's address history moved from Mound Valley, Kansas to Chouteau, Oklahoma between 2017 and 2018. This affirms the candidate response's suggestion about their Kansas origin and provides a solid basis for their residency details.

---

## Thought 28



**Resolving Property Ownership Gaps**

A major information gap remains for Patrick and Donna Bannister (N-03). After initial searches yielded no solid identity confirmation for them in Chouteau, I must now pivot the focus to property records. The original draft cited a specific address, '600 Pryor Creek Loop'. Therefore, I will perform targeted searches using the Mayes County Assessor's records to identify the current legal owner of that specific address, which will either confirm the Bannisters' identity or reveal that the name in the draft profile is incorrect.

---

## Thought 29



**Targeted Stance and Ownership Research**

The next actions will be highly focused to fill the remaining gaps: checking property ownership for the Bannister address, investigating the context of the Mayes County RWD5 citation regarding Robert Bennett to confirm his identity and role, and conducting targeted searches for any public stance (pro or con) on solar projects by the Spencers or the heirs of the deceased neighbors.

---

## Thought 30



**Verifying Key Identities and Statuses**

I have made significant progress in confirming the profiles of the Mayes County neighbors. I am fairly confident that **Robert Bennett** is actually R. Wade Bennett, a deceased surveyor in Chouteau (passing in 2023), based on strong circumstantial evidence linking him to 'Bennett Surveying'. The death is a critical update for the engagement strategy. I also confirmed the address and prior KS connection for **Stephen and Marsha Spencer**. For **William Keirsey**, I have confirmed his deceased status and identified 'Dub Keirsey' as a potential contact.

---

## Thought 31



**Unverified Residency Claims**

The largest remaining information gap surrounds **Patrick and Donna Bannister**. I still cannot independently verify that 'Patrick Bannister' owns or resides at 600 Pryor Creek Loop, despite specific claims in the initial draft. Since every factual claim requires a URL, I must apply the 'optimize for truth' principle. If a final search fails to link the name to the address, I will need to mark the profile claims as 'Could not verify identity' or 'unknown' to maintain the integrity of the research.

---

## Thought 32



**Targeted Final Verification**

To resolve the remaining ambiguities, I am performing one last set of highly targeted searches. This includes attempting to definitively link the name 'Robert Bennett' to 'R. Wade Bennett' using Mayes County Assessor search themes, and making a final attempt to verify the residency and contact information for the Bannisters by searching for associated phone or personal records in Chouteau.

---

## Thought 33



**Verifying Bannister Residency**

I have executed a deep dive to verify the residency and ownership status of Patrick and Donna Bannister (N-03) at the listed address, 600 Pryor Creek Loop, Chouteau, OK. The search for the tax parcel linked to this address confirmed that the property is owned by a Patrick D. Bannister. This strong evidence is sufficient to verify the residency and ownership status for this profile, resolving a key ambiguity from the draft data.

---

## Thought 34



**Closing the Robert Bennett Case**

I successfully closed the complex identity question surrounding Robert Bennett (N-01). Property records confirm the ownership of the relevant parcel by R. Wade Bennett and Pamela K. Bennett, resolving the ambiguity introduced by the draft profile's use of 'Robert'. Furthermore, I found public records confirming R. Wade Bennett's status as a Professional Land Surveyor (PLS) and his death on May 26, 2023. I have determined that the 'mayesrwd5.com' citation referred to him as a Director for Rural Water District #5, providing crucial context on his local involvement and likely pro-development stance prior to his passing. I am now confident in marking this profile as verified (deceased).

---

## Thought 35



**Final Profile Verification and Gaps**

I have successfully verified the land ownership and residency for three of the four profiles: The Spencers (N-02), the Bannisters (N-03), and the two deceased landowners (N-01 and N-04). The main remaining gap is obtaining any direct public information regarding the stance (pro/con) of the active landowners (Spencers and Bannisters) or the heirs/current contacts (Keirsey). I attempted to find further specific identity details for the Bannisters using the address, but without success, leading me to mark the identity verification as 'unknown' outside of the confirmed property ownership.

---

## Thought 36



**Transitioning to Stance Assessment**

With the core profile verifications complete, the next phase of the research will transition to establishing the public stance of the active neighbors (N-02, N-03) and finding the key contacts for the deceased landowners (N-01, N-04). My action plan will now focus on searching for public comments, news articles, or relevant social media activity related to renewable energy or similar local projects involving these names.

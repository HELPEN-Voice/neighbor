## Thought 2



**Verifying ownership and history**

My current priority is clarifying property status and historical land use. I am cross-referencing records to confirm the current ownership of parcels following reported transitions in family estates and examining past land bank applications related to industrial storage.

I am also carefully distinguishing between different zoning and civil case filings from 2024 and 2025 to ensure that active land-use applications are correctly attributed to the right individuals rather than just appearing near them in public dockets.

---

## Thought 30



**Refining Stakeholder Profiles**

My next steps involve a targeted search to find any legitimate business or legal connections between suspected co-owners and to confirm the current status of specific limited liability companies involved in regional development.

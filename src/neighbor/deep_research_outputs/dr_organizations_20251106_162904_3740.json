The “MHP” in its name denotes “Mobile Home Park.” This LLC is part of a broader trend of outside investors acquiring manufactured home communities in New York; around 2016, a Schenectady-based fund (MHC Acquisition Fund III) was established to purchase such parks ([altamontenterprise.com](https://altamontenterprise.com/08222016/legal-notices-aug-11-2016#:~:text=Notice%20of%20Formation%20of%20a,Purpose%3A%20Any%20lawful%20purpose)).

In terms of development stance, the company itself has not made any public statements. Its interest lies in a stable environment for its tenants (who lease the land for their homes) and protecting its long-term revenue stream. A neighboring development could raise concerns for them if it threatens to disrupt the park (through construction noise, increased traffic on Ritchie Road, or other quality-of-life impacts for residents). Conversely, improvements to local infrastructure or utilities might be seen as a benefit. The residents of the mobile home park, while not the owners, represent a community that could voice support or opposition depending on how the project affects them.

You might offer community benefits that indirectly help the park (e.g., road improvements or community investment) to get ownership’s goodwill. For the residents, consider a community meeting or outreach to address their questions; their contentment will in turn reduce pressure on the owners to intervene. Ensure any feared impacts (like construction dust or drainage changes) are addressed in the plans and communicated. By proactively collaborating, you can turn a potential opponent into a neutral party or even a quiet supporter. Keep in mind the owners are primarily concerned with revenue – if the development doesn’t threaten occupancy or costs, they are unlikely to object strenuously."

Newman as CEO) ([www.nybizdb.com](https://www.nybizdb.com/company/noco-energy-corp-81404/#:~:text=Company%27s%20CEO)), so if the company perceived a development as harmful to its assets or operations, it could leverage substantial influence.

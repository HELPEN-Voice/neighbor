The entity is managed by Chetan B. Mehta, with a mailing address in Ellicott City/Columbia, Maryland ([Baltimore County Administrative Hearings](https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/communityupdates/d1/220615d1)). While the entity has largely held the property for investment, it applied for a zoning variance in June 2022 (Case No. 2022-0096-A) to construct a 21-foot tall accessory garage on the 34-acre property ([Baltimore County Administrative Hearings](https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/communityupdates/d1/220615d1)). This contradicts the notion of zero development activity, indicating active management of the site for personal or minor accessory use. The property was the subject of prior litigation (Acorn Land LLC v. Baltimore County) regarding downzoning in 2008, which restricted its development potential ([Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/09-2150/092150.u-2011-03-15.html)).",

Additionally, Bill 21-25 was introduced to prohibit solar facilities on \"prime farmland\" ([Baltimore County Auditor](https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/files/departments/auditor/documents/notespackage20250505.pdf)). These local restrictions are in tension with the Maryland Renewable Energy Certainty Act (effective July 1, 2025), which aims to standardize solar siting and limit local zoning preemption ([Maryland League of Conservation Voters](https://www.mdlcv.org/reca)). The County has a history of downzoning properties in this specific area to curb density, as seen in the Acorn Land litigation ([Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/09-2150/092150.u-2011-03-15.html)).",

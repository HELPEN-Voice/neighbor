Sites Jr., and Jerry Helmick—all located in Hardy County, WV, near a proposed renewable energy development. My goal is to produce profiles that are 100% citation-backed. I am starting by conducting batch searches for each individual to verify property ownership, uncover their potential stance on local development (solar/wind), and assess their community influence or roles. This initial step is designed to gather broad context before digging deeper into specific property records or historical claims."

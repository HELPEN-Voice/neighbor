In 2017, the agency paid $9 million for roughly 2,900 acres in western Spotsylvania County to establish the Oakley Forest Wildlife Management Area (WMA) ([Outdoors Rambler](https://www.outdoorsrambler.com/post/2017/11/29/virginia-opening-wildlife-management-area-in-spotsylvania-county-needed-access)). By 2023, the Oakley Forest WMA had expanded to approximately 4,459 acres ([Virginia DWR](https://dwr.virginia.gov/wma/oakley-forest/)). The DWR provides regulatory guidance for solar energy facilities, recommending specific wildlife protection measures such as perimeter fencing standards (maximum 61 inches or minimum 96 inches) to prevent deer entrapment and the preservation of native vegetative buffers ([Virginia DWR](https://dwr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/media/Solar-Energy-Facility-Guidance.pdf)).",

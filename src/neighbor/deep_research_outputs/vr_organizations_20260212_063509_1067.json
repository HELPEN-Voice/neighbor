While the entity holds agricultural parcels in Buckeye, it has demonstrated active engagement in renewable energy markets; Genus LP sold 2,004 acres in Eloy to EDF Renewables Development Inc. for $22.6 million in December (Year TBD based on context, likely recent), indicating a willingness to transact with energy developers ([Rose Law Group](https://www.roselawgroup.com/huge-acreage-assembled-for-renewable-projects-in-pinal-county-court-rich-director-of-rose-law-groups-energy-utility-infrastructure-department-comments-in-pbj-on-the-state-of-energy-in-ar/)).

These preliminary details provide a foundation for understanding the local social landscape surrounding the development.

---

## Thought 14



**Verifying Residency and Ties**

A significant point of investigation involves reconciling conflicting information regarding residency and specific land ownership. I am looking into whether one stakeholder is truly based in Oklahoma or remains a local resident, as this distinction is vital for accurate profiling. Furthermore, I am evaluating the validity of reported connections to local businesses and historical family estates to ensure that every claim in the final profile is substantively grounded.

---

## Thought 15



**Investigating Public Records**

To move forward, I will analyze county property data and public archives to verify exact land holdings and geographic proximity to the proposed site. I am also planning to examine local meeting minutes and historical records to determine if these individuals have expressed any formal stances on zoning or renewable energy, allowing me to build a more comprehensive and verified narrative for each profile.

---

## Thought 16



**Refining Research Focus**

I've observed that initial data collection yielded irrelevant results, prompting a shift toward more precise inquiries. I am now concentrating on verifying the land ownership and residency status of specific individuals in Saline County, particularly focusing on the Dunning and Ward families to establish their proximity to the area of interest.

---

## Thought 17



**Analyzing Stakeholder Backgrounds**

I am synthesizing information regarding potential business ties, such as connections to the Salina Planing Mill, and exploring familial lineages to determine if current landowners inherited their interests. This involves resolving whether certain owners are local residents or managing their properties from out of state, which may influence their perspective on regional changes.

---

## Thought 18



**Evaluating Public Stances**

My next steps involve cross-referencing property records with public archives and local documentation to identify any expressed opinions on solar development. I will be looking for specific mentions of these stakeholders in community discussions to understand the prevailing sentiment regarding local land use.

---

## Thought 19



**Professional and Civic Backgrounds**

I have established that one individual holds a long-term leadership position in a local industrial company and has participated in regional political processes. I also identified potential multi-generational connections within the area, which provides a clearer picture of their established presence and influence in the community.

---

## Thought 20



**Verifying Geographic Proximity**

I am currently resolving a discrepancy regarding a stakeholder’s primary residence versus their business location to confirm how closely they live to the proposed project. Simultaneously, I am investigating a familial link between a historical local estate and a landowner currently based out of state to determine if their interests remain tied to the region's agricultural preservation.

---

## Thought 21



**Synthesizing Public Records**

I will now proceed to examine archived family documentation and regional planning records for any formal statements or affiliations related to energy development. This involves a targeted review of public meeting documentation and local discourse to identify specific concerns or support for the upcoming changes to the landscape.

---

## Thought 22



**Mapping Local Connections**

I have successfully linked one individual to a leadership role within a local manufacturing firm and another to a multi-generational farming legacy in the Mentor area. These confirmed professional and agricultural backgrounds provide a clearer picture of their historical and economic ties to the regional landscape.

---

## Thought 23



**Verifying Current Interests**

I am currently working to bridge the gap between historical family records and current land titles. While I have established a clear inheritance link, I am focused on verifying that property ownership remains active and reconciling residential data to ensure the reported proximity to the development area is precise.

**Confirming Local Leadership and Lineage**

I have successfully linked one stakeholder to a prominent leadership role at a local manufacturing firm and established their family’s long-standing connection to the community through regional educational records. Additionally, I have confirmed the specific familial origins of an out-of-state landowner, tracing her roots back to a well-known regional dairy farming operation. These findings solidify the historical and professional standing of these key parties within the local context.

---

## Thought 26



**Validating Residential and Agricultural Claims**

I am currently focusing on reconciling specific residential addresses that have appeared in preliminary findings but lack definitive public record verification. I am also investigating claims regarding agricultural subsidies and land ownership associated with the absentee stakeholder to confirm her active interest in the region's acreage. While their backgrounds are becoming clearer, their official stances on the proposed land use remain undocumented in the public sphere.

---

## Thought 27



**Targeted Verification and Stance Assessment**

I will now conduct a final, targeted inquiry into specific geographic records to pin down exact residential locations and verify current ownership status through agricultural data.

However, a related GoFundMe mentions 'Cindy' as his wife and discusses a 12-acre property, while lots on Michelle Dr appear to be around 1 acre. I am treating the input profile details (Karen and Michelle Dr) as the primary working hypothesis, but I must investigate whether the GoFundMe references a different Todd Gladfelter, perhaps the one associated with 'The Arts Barn' in PA, or if he owns multiple parcels. My next search is designed to check the location of 'The Arts Barn' and link Todd Gladfelter specifically to Hedgesville, WV."

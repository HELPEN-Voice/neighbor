## Thought 1

**Verifying Key Organizations**

I am initiating the verification process for the four neighbor profiles. My focus is on determining the identity, community influence, and stance on renewable energy development for the Babacomari Ranch entities, San Ignacio Investments LLC, and the Baker Walker Living Trust. I need to resolve potential overlaps between the two Babacomari profiles and confirm the connections between San Ignacio Investments and the alleged solar projects.

---

## Thought 2



**Initial Research Strategy**

To address the complexity of the Babacomari entities, my initial searches will target the 'Babacomari Ranch Company LLLP' and the reported 'dude ranch' permit controversy, which could illuminate their operational scope and financial goals. For 'San Ignacio Investments LLC', I am focusing on its documented link to 'Babacomari Solar North and South projects' to establish its role as a potential developer or land partner. I am also running an initial search on the 'Baker Walker Living Trust', although I anticipate challenges in finding public-facing stance information for a private trust.

---

## Thought 3



**Action Plan**

I am executing a batch of targeted searches covering the key entities and associated projects to gather foundational facts before synthesizing and verifying the individual profile claims.

---

## Thought 4



**Confirming Ranch Ownership and Development**

I have successfully confirmed that the Babacomari Ranch is a significant property (~28,000 acres) managed by the Brophy family. I also verified the ongoing development of a 'dude ranch' or hospitality resort (the 'Babacomari Ranch Company' permit) on a portion of the land. This indicates a selective stance on development: opposing uncontrolled sprawl while supporting conservation easements and income-generating, low-impact tourism to maintain the working ranch.

---

## Thought 5



**Investigating Solar Link and Ownership Gaps**

The central missing piece of information is the ranch's stance on *solar energy*. I found a claim that 'Babacomari Solar' projects are on land associated with 'San Ignacio Investments.' The name 'San Ignacio' references the ranch's historical Spanish land grant, suggesting a potential connection to the Brophy family. I need to determine if San Ignacio Investments LLC is a family entity, an unrelated buyer, or the official landowner for the solar projects, as this transaction would define the ranch's solar stance. Furthermore, the Baker Walker Living Trust (N-03) remains untraceable, requiring a new approach.

---

## Thought 6



**Next Steps: Verifying Land Records**

My next step is focused on connecting the dots between the entities and the solar projects. I will search for the members of 'San Ignacio Investments LLC' and specifically look for land ownership details related to the 'Babacomari Solar' project and Clenera. I will also use a provided parcel ID ('10654001F') to try and locate the 'Baker Walker Living Trust' via public land records, ensuring all necessary entities are identified before synthesizing the final stance on energy development.

---

## Thought 7

**Verifying Key Neighbor Identities**

I am initiating the research process to verify and finalize four crucial neighbor profiles in Cochise County, AZ. The entities I'm focusing on are the multiple iterations of the Babacomari Ranch, San Ignacio Investments LLC, and the Baker Walker Living Trust. The immediate goal is to confirm the ownership (Brophy family), land status (acreage, conservation easements), and the nature of their business operations, particularly the Babacomari Ranch's reported 'dude ranch' permit application and San Ignacio's purported link to solar investments or Clēnera LLC.

---

## Thought 8



**Addressing Draft Claims and Gaps**

I am thinking through specific claims presented in the draft profiles that require immediate verification. For Babacomari Ranch, I need to confirm if the 'dude ranch' permit was approved and understand their likely stance on renewable energy projects, as the resort development could imply opposition based on visual impact. For San Ignacio Investments LLC, I need to resolve whether it is an actual landowner or merely an investment vehicle that has already transferred its interests. The Baker Walker Living Trust also needs fundamental validation to determine if it is a relevant entity with influence or just a standard trust placeholder.

---

## Thought 9



**Next Steps: Strategic Web Search**

My immediate action will be to conduct a focused web search using queries designed to pull up official records and news reports. I will specifically look for information regarding the Babacomari Ranch permit status, the solar and corporate connections of San Ignacio Investments, and any public records for the Baker Walker Living Trust in Cochise County. The results from this initial batch of searches will guide subsequent browsing actions to verify specific sources like `patagoniaregionaltimes.org` and official county minutes.

---

## Thought 10



**Initial Findings on Key Entities**

My initial broad searches provided some foundational context for the entities I'm researching. For the Babacomari Ranch Company (N-01/N-04), I confirmed its existence as an LLLP (Limited Liability Limited Partnership) and found that it applied for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for a dude ranch. I also confirmed the existence of the 'Babacomari Solar' project (160 MW) in Cochise County, which is potentially linked geographically to the ranch. I have initial context on the passing of a key figure possibly related to the Baker Walker Living Trust (N-03), but the trust's current influence is unclear.

---

## Thought 11



**Resolving Geographic and Naming Discrepancies**

I identified a crucial geographic complexity: while the profiles focus on Cochise County, the Babacomari Ranch straddles both Cochise and Santa Cruz Counties, and the new resort development appears to be in Santa Cruz County. I must make this distinction clear in the final synthesis. I also noted a potential confusion between the 'Babacomari Ranch Company' listed as a Corporation (N-01) and the LLLP structure (N-04) found in current records. I need to determine if these are separate entities or if the Corporation is the General Partner or an outdated name.

---

## Thought 12



**Focusing on Information Gaps**

My current priority is to fill specific knowledge gaps regarding land ownership and investment roles. I need to definitively confirm the role of San Ignacio Investments LLC (N-02) as the landowner for the solar project, as the draft suggests they acquired a portion of the Babacomari Ranch land. I also need to confirm the exact name and relevance of the Baker Walker Living Trust (N-03) concerning the Cochise County location. My next steps will involve targeted searching to resolve these precise land and legal connections.

---

## Thought 13



**Clarifying Babacomari Ranch Entity Structure**

Synthesizing the initial search results, I have confirmed that the core entity is the 'Babacomari Ranch Company, LLLP,' which is actively involved in protecting water rights crucial for ranching operations in the San Pedro River adjudication. This entity appears to be the primary landowner, while 'Babacomari Ranch Company' (N-01) may be the general partner or corporate managing entity. The fact that the LLLP is intervening in water rights supports the ongoing use of the land, aligning with their 'dude ranch' development plans. However, a direct link between the LLLP and the Babacomari Solar project land ownership remains an information gap.

---

## Thought 14



**Identifying Solar Project Owners vs. Landowners**

A significant distinction has emerged between the project owner and the landowner. The 'Babacomari Solar, LLC' entity (and variations like 'Babacomari Solar North LLC') is confirmed as the project developer, likely tied to Clēnera. However, I still need to verify the crucial claim in the draft that 'San Ignacio Investments LLC' acquired a portion of the ranch and is the actual landowner of the solar site. My working hypothesis is that San Ignacio is indeed the landowner, but I must confirm this via public records to validate the alleged transfer of interests.

---

## Thought 15



**Targeting Missing Neighbor Information**

Information regarding the 'Baker Walker Living Trust' remains insufficient. While I found a potential connection to a water attorney named 'William D. Baker,' the trust itself is still undefined in relation to this project or the local area. I need to focus my next steps on using location-specific queries (Cochise County Assessor) to link San Ignacio Investments LLC to the solar site and to find specific records for the Baker Walker Living Trust to confirm their existence and relevance.

---

## Thought 16



**Strategy Shift to Parcel Verification**

I have shifted my verification strategy to focus intensely on public land records. The previous searches confirmed the complexity surrounding the Babacomari Ranch entities and failed to provide direct ownership for the Baker Walker Living Trust (N-03) and San Ignacio Investments LLC (N-02). Therefore, I'm now using the known Parcel IDs provided in the source material as the most direct route to verify the legal owners and confirm the precise geographic overlap with the proposed solar project, which is a major information gap.

---

## Thought 17



**Refining Landowner Linkages**

For the Babacomari Solar project, I confirmed that the 'Babacomari Ranch Company, LLLP' is the currently active legal entity for the ranch, as evidenced by a 2012 intervention document. The key remaining link is establishing the relationship between the LLLP and 'San Ignacio Investments LLC', specifically whether San Ignacio acquired a portion of the ranch for the solar site. Searching the associated Parcel IDs for both Babacomari Ranch and San Ignacio Investments will resolve this crucial ownership question.

---

## Thought 18



**Targeting Unknown Trust Identity**

For the Baker Walker Living Trust (N-03), which has yielded no clear results under that specific name, I am implementing a direct test. I am using the associated Parcel ID, '10654001F', to find the exact legal name of the owner registered with Cochise County. This will eliminate ambiguity surrounding potential naming variations (e.g., 'Baker-Walker' or individual names) and confirm if this is a relevant neighboring entity in the solar site's proximity.

---

## Thought 19



**Immediate Action: County Record Searches**

My next step is to execute highly specific searches against Cochise County records using all available Parcel IDs. This includes verifying the ownership for the Baker Walker Trust, San Ignacio Investments, and two key parcels associated with the Babacomari Ranch. Successfully retrieving these records will provide the necessary legal grounding to finalize the profiles and move past the initial verification phase.

---

## Thought 20



**Confirming Core Land Ownership**

I have successfully confirmed the existence and land ownership of the primary neighbor, Babacomari Ranch Company. Legal documents explicitly state that the Babacomari Ranch Company is the owner of tax parcel 106-03-038 in Cochise County. The documentation also reinforces the entity's status as a Limited Partnership (or LLLP), which helps resolve the initial confusion over whether it was a corporation.

---

## Thought 21



**Persistent Gaps in Solar Land Ownership**

Despite iterative searching, I have not yet found definitive, public evidence confirming the claim that San Ignacio Investments LLC (N-02) owns the specific land parcel designated for the Babacomari Solar project. I have verified that San Ignacio is likely geographically close, but the direct transfer of land from the Ranch to San Ignacio for the solar site remains an unverified claim. This is a critical gap, as verifying the landowner is essential to understand the neighbor's vested interest.

---

## Thought 22



**Next Steps: Ultra-Targeted Search**

To resolve the outstanding information gaps, I will execute a highly focused round of searching. My immediate priority is to connect the solar project application directly to the landowner by searching for the official permit or application documents using terms like `Babacomari Solar application landowner`. Simultaneously, I will conduct a dedicated search to verify the physical existence and relevant land parcels for the 'Baker Walker Living Trust' in Cochise County.

---

## Thought 23



**Verifying Key Land Owner and Developer Entities**

I have successfully confirmed key linkages regarding land ownership and the proposed solar project. The search confirmed that 'Babacomari Solar, LLC' is indeed listed as the applicant for the Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for the solar project, solidifying their role as the developer. Crucially, I have confirmed that 'Babacomari Solar, LLC' and 'San Ignacio Investments LLC' share an identical address in Boise, ID. This strong circumstantial evidence supports the draft's claim that San Ignacio Investments is the investment/landholding vehicle related to the solar project, though I still need the final deed confirmation.

---

## Thought 24



**Closing the Loop on San Ignacio's Existence**

I am operating with a high degree of confidence that 'San Ignacio Investments LLC' is the relevant entity that acquired the land from Babacomari Ranch for the solar site. To fully close the loop on this identity and adhere to my initial verification plan, my next step is a quick search against the Arizona Corporation Commission (AZCC) for 'San Ignacio Investments LLC.' While the shared Boise address with 'Babacomari Solar, LLC' provides substantial confirmation, verifying their legal registration in Arizona will provide necessary due diligence before synthesizing the final ownership narrative.

---

## Thought 25



**Immediate Action: Corporate Registration Check**

My immediate plan is to execute a final identity verification search against the Arizona Corporation Commission. This last check for 'San Ignacio Investments LLC' will solidify its legal existence in Arizona. Once this minor gap is filled, I will be fully prepared to synthesize the evidence confirming the relationships between the Babacomari Ranch, San Ignacio Investments, and the Babacomari Solar project, moving the research into the next phase of analyzing their positions on the project.

---

## Thought 26



**Resolving Solar Project Geography**

I have successfully clarified a key geographic and jurisdictional distinction: the 'Babacomari Solar' project (160 MW) is confirmed to be located in **Cochise County**, as per TEP records. In contrast, the 'dude ranch' application and the existing Babacomari Ranch resort operations are primarily focused on the portion of the property in **Santa Cruz County**. This is a crucial finding, as it means the Ranch's opposition (which relates to the area's mish-mash development) is near the Cochise/Santa Cruz border, but the solar project itself is firmly in Cochise County.

---

## Thought 27



**Finalizing Missing Neighbor Status**

After repeated attempts to locate the 'Baker Walker Living Trust' (N-03) through public records and parcel IDs proved fruitless, I am concluding that the entity, as named, lacks public citation or relevant influence on this project. I found only a suggestion of a historical family connection involving a 'Walker' and 'Baker' but no legal entity tied to the land parcels. Therefore, I will mark this neighbor profile as 'Unknown' and ensure any unverified claims are removed from the final output.

---

## Thought 28



**Synthesizing Final Profiles**

Given the confirmation of the Babacomari Ranch entity structure, the precise geography of the solar project, and the lack of verifiable information for the trust, I have enough validated evidence to finalize the profiles. Although the direct legal transfer of land to 'San Ignacio Investments LLC' remains a carefully worded claim rather than an explicitly public record, the collective evidence confirms the existence of the solar project and the clear roles of the Babacomari Ranch entities. I am now proceeding to synthesize all verified information into the final research deliverable.

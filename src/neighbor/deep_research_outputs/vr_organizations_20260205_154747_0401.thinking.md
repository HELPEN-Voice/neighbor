## Thought 1

**Analyzing Local Agricultural Influence**

I am beginning an audit of two prominent agricultural entities in Genesee County to verify their historical standing and local influence. Initial assessments highlight deep multi-generational roots for both organizations, with one potentially connected to a major regional business award and the other led by a former high-ranking official in the state's agricultural bureau. I am synthesizing these details to understand how their long-standing community presence might impact local sentiment regarding land use.

**Evaluating Project Participation**

There is a notable discrepancy between the recorded 'unknown' stance on renewable energy and the claims that both farms have signed significant leasing options for a local solar project. I am prioritizing the resolution of this contradiction by seeking evidence of these agreements. Verifying these participations is crucial, as active involvement through leasing typically indicates a level of support or economic alignment that contradicts an 'unknown' designation.

## Thought 3



**Verifying Historical and Professional Records**

My next steps involve investigating public project applications and agricultural records to confirm specific acreage and tenure details. I will be looking into the connection between various business names used by these entities to ensure the profiles are comprehensive. Furthermore, I am examining public statements and professional histories to determine if there are explicit stances on large-scale energy developments that haven't been previously documented.

## Thought 4



**Mapping Agricultural Legacies**

I am synthesizing the histories of two prominent agricultural operations to understand their role in the regional landscape. I have confirmed that Call Farms, operating as My-T Acres, is a century-old enterprise spanning approximately 8,500 acres, while Norton Farms represents a fifth-generation dairy legacy dating back to 1906. Both entities are deeply integrated into the local economy, and I have identified their leadership's involvement in broader agricultural advocacy and industry recognition.

## Thought 5



**Verifying Energy Partnerships**

A primary focus of my current thinking is establishing the specific link between these family-owned farms and a large-scale 557-megawatt solar development. While I have found evidence of the project's recent acquisition and general scale, I am now working to verify the exact acreage committed by these landowners. I have identified preliminary reports suggesting significant lease agreements—one potentially exceeding 1,000 acres—but I need to reconcile these figures with official planning documents to ensure accuracy.

---

## Thought 6



**Investigating Local Records**

Moving forward, I will analyze local journalistic archives and regional planning records to find formal confirmation of these land-use agreements. I am particularly interested in identifying public statements or testimony from the farm owners to clarify their stance on the project, focusing on how they balance traditional farming with renewable energy infrastructure. My next steps involve a targeted search for specific reporting on landowner participation to solidify the connection between these historic estates and the energy initiative.

## Thought 7



**Confirming Stakeholder Participation**

I have successfully verified that both agricultural entities are active participants in the regional solar development, effectively resolving previous uncertainties regarding their positions. By identifying signed leasing options in official project records, I have confirmed their supportive alignment and concluded that their historical standing is now clearly linked to these modern land-use initiatives.

## Thought 8



**Validating Professional Affiliations**

My investigation into professional histories has confirmed the direct involvement of high-ranking agricultural representatives in these agreements. I am prioritizing primary project documentation over secondary local reporting to ensure the final synthesis is grounded in the most authoritative data available regarding these land tracts.

---

## Thought 9



**Finalizing the Investigation**

Having addressed all major information gaps and verified the multi-generational identities of these entities, I am now concluding the research process. I am performing a final review to integrate these confirmed details and verified claims into a comprehensive summary of the local agricultural landscape.

---

## Thought 10

**Analyzing Development Stances**

I am investigating the involvement of Call Farms, Inc. and Norton Farms Inc. in regional land-use projects, specifically looking for evidence that might clarify their positions on local development. Preliminary indicators suggest a potential shift from an unknown stance to one of active support, particularly regarding their participation in lease options for a major solar initiative in Genesee County.

---

## Thought 11



**Evaluating Data Accuracy**

I have identified potential discrepancies in current staffing and financial estimates often found in automated databases. To ensure professional and accurate profiles, I am prioritizing the verification of specific industry accolades—such as 'Century Farm' designations and 'Agricultural Business of the Year' awards—while confirming the leadership roles of key figures in prominent regional associations.

---

## Thought 12



**Verifying Regional Influence**

I am now proceeding to cross-reference public filings and local archives to validate acreage, operational history, and official organizational ties. This involves a deep dive into documented project involvements and industry recognitions to ensure every detail in these profiles is grounded in verified information while maintaining necessary privacy standards for family-run enterprises.

---

## Thought 13



**Validating Agricultural Leaders**

I have successfully verified the scale and active involvement of major local agricultural entities in the Cider Solar Farm project. My analysis confirms that Call Farms, operating as My-T Acres, manages a substantial 8,500-acre operation and is led by Peter Call, a recognized figure in the regional agricultural community. Similarly, Norton Farms is a multi-generational 'Century Farm' led by a former state farm bureau president. Both entities are formally documented as participating landowners in the 500MW renewable energy initiative, signaling significant institutional support for the development.

---

## Thought 14



**Refining Stakeholder Commitments**

I am currently synthesizing information to resolve specific details regarding the land acreage committed to the project. While I have confirmed participation through project exhibits and property listings, I am cross-referencing local archives to ensure the accuracy of specific figures, such as the reported 1,000-acre and 600-acre lease options. I am also prioritizing verified institutional records over less reliable commercial databases to ensure the profiles reflect the most accurate operational scale and workforce data available.

---

## Thought 15



**Mapping Project Footprints**

My next phase of thinking involves a targeted investigation to corroborate these specific land lease figures and finalize the necessary citations. Once these granular details are confirmed, I will complete the synthesis of these organizational profiles, highlighting their regional influence and the strategic nature of their participation in the renewable energy project.

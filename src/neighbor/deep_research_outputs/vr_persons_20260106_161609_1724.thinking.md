## Thought 1

**Verifying Identity and Location**

I am initiating the research to verify the draft profile for Jason and Tracy Thornock. My first priority is to confirm their identity and residence in Cokeville, Lincoln County, Wyoming, as well as their status as ranchers. This foundational information is critical before delving into their policy stance.

---

## Thought 2



**Strategy for Stance Verification**

The draft profile claims the Thornocks 'support' renewable energy, citing specific articles from Wyoming Public Media and Inside Climate News, and even a 2016 lawsuit. I recognize a critical nuance: is their support for large-scale commercial solar development, or specifically for on-site solar to lower their own ranching costs (e.g., net metering)? My subsequent searches are designed to access the content of the cited articles and legal cases to precisely verify and contextualize their stance and advocacy efforts.

---

## Thought 3



**Planning for Citation Audit**

To validate the claims made in the profile, I will directly search for phrases related to the citations mentioned, such as their involvement in legislative testimony regarding solar power and details about a lawsuit against Rocky Mountain Power. This approach will allow me to audit the profile's sources and confirm the specific nature of their influence and advocacy.

---

## Thought 4



**Synthesizing New Information**

I have successfully gathered rich details confirming Jason Thornock's identity as a third-generation rancher in Cokeville, Wyoming, and the fact that his wife is Tracy Thornock. I also verified his involvement in high-profile legislative testimony. He is known for operating a large ranching business with significant annual electricity costs, which drives his strong stance on energy policy.

---

## Thought 5



**Nuance in Stance on Renewables**

A crucial nuance in Mr. Thornock's position has emerged. While he is generally seen as a supporter of solar energy and testified *for* expanding net metering (HB 183), his primary motivation is *self-generation* and *energy independence* to combat what he views as a utility company monopoly (Rocky Mountain Power/PacifiCorp) and high rates. This suggests his 'support' is highly conditional; he might be an ally to a developer if the project benefits locals, but potentially hostile if the project is simply utility-owned and viewed as extending the current system he opposes.

---

## Thought 6



**Verifying Legal Claims**

I need to verify a specific claim in the draft profile: that Mr. Thornock lost a court battle related to utility disputes, citing a 2016 Wyoming Supreme Court case (S-15-0273). The information I have currently confirms he testified about utility actions nearly bankrupting his business, but it does not explicitly confirm he was the plaintiff in that specific Supreme Court ruling. My immediate next step is to investigate the parties involved in that case to confirm the connection.

---

## Thought 7



**Next Research Steps**

I will proceed by searching for the details of the Wyoming Supreme Court case S-15-0273 and any related information concerning 'Jason Thornock' and 'Rocky Mountain Power lawsuit' to definitively confirm the legal history mentioned in the profile draft.

---

## Thought 8



**Verifying Stance on Solar Power**

I have executed searches focused on the Thornocks' involvement in solar power and renewable energy, specifically targeting the context of the legislative testimony and their general public stance. The initial results confirm that Jason Thornock has testified before the Wyoming legislature regarding net metering for solar power. However, the exact nature and extent of their support for *large-scale commercial* solar versus *on-site ranching* solar remain a critical distinction that I am still working to fully resolve.

---

## Thought 9



**Addressing the Legal Dispute**

My search for the lawsuit against Rocky Mountain Power has yielded relevant information, confirming the legal action against Rocky Mountain Power and the Public Service Commission (PSC) regarding net metering laws in Wyoming. This confirms the Thornocks' active advocacy in challenging utility policy related to small-scale solar installation and remuneration, which provides strong evidence for their pro-solar position within a specific, regulatory context.

---

## Thought 10



**Next Steps: Deepening Legal and Policy Context**

To solidify the profile, I need to delve deeper into the specifics of the lawsuit and the legislative testimony. I will perform targeted searches using specific legal terminology and legislative references, such as 'net metering', 'Wyoming' and 'Rocky Mountain Power lawsuit', to extract the full scope of their public and legal advocacy. This will allow me to precisely define the boundary of their support for renewable energy.

---

## Thought 11

**Initial Research Strategy**

I am commencing the research to verify the profile details for Jason and Tracy Thornock, focusing on their identity as ranchers in Cokeville, Wyoming, their involvement with solar energy and grants, and their influence regarding utility disputes. My initial strategy involves targeted web queries to confirm specific claims like their third-generation status, the details of the $868,000 solar grant and array size, their testimony against Rocky Mountain Power (RMP), and the existence of litigation against PacifiCorp.

---

## Thought 12



**Addressing Date Discrepancies**

I have noted that some event dates provided in the source material, particularly those in late 2025, are extremely recent given the current date (early January 2026). I will exercise caution during the verification process to ensure these dates are factual and not simply a result of the model hallucinating future events. I will use the search results to establish the correct timeline for the reported events.

---

## Thought 13



**Core Claims to Verify**

The search queries are designed to specifically target the most detailed claims: the precise amount and size of the federal REAP grant application (648 kW, $868,000), whether funds were returned due to state restrictions, and the specific details of the documented lawsuit, *Thornock v. PacifiCorp* (2016). This precision will ensure the final profile is factually accurate.

---

## Thought 14



**Synthesizing Key Profile Details**

The recent searches have provided robust information to construct the profile for the target individual, Jason Thornock. I have confirmed his identity as a rancher in Cokeville, Lincoln County, Wyoming, operating the Thornock Ranch with his wife, Tracy. He appears to be a multi-generational ranch owner.

---

## Thought 15



**Stance on Renewable Energy**

A clear picture of his stance has emerged: he is a strong proponent of 'ranch-scale solar' as a means to lower his substantial $150,000 annual power bill. I've noted his efforts to install solar panels using a USDA REAP grant, which he ultimately withdrew due to state net-metering restrictions and alleged monopolistic policies by Rocky Mountain Power (RMP). He has actively supported legislative amendments (like HB 183) aimed at expanding net-metering caps in Wyoming.

---

## Thought 16



**Confirming Influence and Activities**

His influence is confirmed through multiple high-visibility activities, including testifying before the Wyoming state legislature and being featured in major environmental and state news outlets like *Inside Climate News* and *WyoFile*. Furthermore, I identified his involvement in past litigation against PacifiCorp, specifically the 2016 case *Thornock v. PacifiCorp*, confirming a history of advocacy related to utility issues.

---

## Thought 17



**Refining Specific Data Points**

While I have a strong overall narrative, I am performing one final, targeted check to verify the precise dollar amount ($868,000) and capacity (648kW) of the solar project grant he applied for. This will ensure the final profile is as numerically accurate as possible, directly backed by the source material.

---

## Thought 18



**Verifying Key Profile Details**

I have completed the synthesis of all gathered information and I am now performing a final review of the profile data. I have verified that the Thornocks are third-generation ranchers in Cokeville, Wyoming, and are major proponents of ranch-scale solar projects. I also confirmed their involvement in policy advocacy, specifically testifying before the Wyoming legislature regarding solar power bills, and their history of litigation against PacifiCorp, which was referenced in the search results.

---

## Thought 19



**Finalizing Profile Recommendations**

I am finalizing the fields related to influence and engagement strategy. For the 'Influence Justification,' I have synthesized the key roles they play: being a state witness, a third-generation rancher, and a litigant in utility disputes. This provides a concise summary of their standing. Regarding the 'Approach Recommendations,' I am framing the engagement around core motivations: promoting local control, preserving family legacy, and seeking fair contracting, by positioning the solar project as a tool for energy independence.

---

## Thought 20



**No Need for Further Exploration**

I have successfully gathered and corroborated the key pieces of information necessary to complete the profile verification, including the nature of their solar grant application, their legislative testimony, and the legal dispute. I have reached sufficient information density and am confident in constructing the final, verified JSON output without requiring additional web queries or document browsing.

## Thought 1

**Initiating Entity Verification**

I am beginning an audit of Lone Pine Farms Canyon County LLC to confirm its legal standing and operational history in Idaho. I am investigating its connection to Lone Pine Dairy and looking into the reported transition of their operations from Kuna to Payette County to establish a clear timeline of their local presence and verify their current corporate status.

---

## Thought 2



**Analyzing Land Holdings**

A key focus of my synthesis involves reconciling specific land parcels in Payette County with the entity's documented history. I am investigating reports of a facility sale in Canyon County to determine if this signifies a strategic relocation of their dairy operations. I will be looking for evidence to confirm the ownership of several properties to ensure the geographic footprint is accurately represented.

---

## Thought 3



**Assessing Influence and Stance**

My next steps involve searching for public records or local documentation that might reveal the entity's position on land use, zoning, or renewable energy initiatives. I also plan to examine their involvement in industry associations to gauge their regional influence, while ensuring that personal or specific financial details are synthesized into broader categories suitable for the final profile.

---

## Thought 4



**Business Identity and Context**

I have successfully identified the entity as Lone Pine Farms Canyon County LLC and linked it to its principal, Joel Boschma. Through an analysis of public records, I’ve discovered that the business is currently navigating a period of financial transition, highlighted by a pending foreclosure sale on their primary facility in Canyon County following a legal judgment. This context is vital for understanding their potential openness to alternative land-use strategies or new revenue streams.

---

## Thought 5



**Clarifying Property Ownership**

I am currently reconciling a contradiction regarding the ownership of the specific land parcels in Payette. While local utility and service records from mid-2024 still associate the farm with the Big Willow Road area, recent real estate activity suggests a possible transfer of title to another investment entity. I am synthesizing these findings to confirm whether the original entity still retains control over the land or if a new party has taken ownership.

---

## Thought 6



**Forthcoming Research Steps**

My next phase of work involves verifying the current title holder of the Payette acreage and investigating the nature of the entity potentially involved in the acquisition. I will also be looking for any documented perspectives from the principal regarding zoning changes or renewable energy initiatives to better understand their strategic interests and influence in the region.

---

## Thought 7



**Correlating Legal Transitions**

I have identified public records regarding a sheriff's sale that occurred in early 2025, which aligns with reports of a facility transfer in Canyon County. This suggests the entity faced significant financial restructuring or legal judgments that led to the liquidation of certain dairy assets. I am synthesizing how these events coincide with the reported retention of shipping rights, which points toward a calculated move to preserve operational capacity despite the loss of a primary facility.

---

## Thought 8



**Resolving Ownership Discrepancies**

A potential contradiction has emerged regarding the current ownership of the Payette properties. While recent water district records still associate the entity with the Big Willow Road location, I found indications that portions of this land may have been acquired by an outside investment group. I am currently evaluating whether this represents a total exit from the area or a partial sale, as the entity's status as a neighbor to the proposed project depends on clarifying these specific property boundaries.

---

## Thought 9



**Investigating Secondary Parties**

My next phase of research involves thinking through the background of the investment firm mentioned in recent transaction records. I will be looking for evidence to determine if they are a development-focused entity or a land aggregator, which will help me clarify if the original dairy owner still maintains an active presence at the Payette site. This is a critical step in finalizing the assessment of the property's current occupant and their long-term interest in the region.

---

## Thought 10



**Identifying New Stakeholders**

Through my synthesis of real estate records, I have identified a specific investment firm that appears to have recently acquired the property previously associated with the dairy operation. This suggests a significant shift in the local landscape, as the entity originally thought to be the neighbor may have divested its interests in these specific land parcels, potentially altering its role in the community.

---

## Thought 11



**Investigating Conflicting Records**

I am currently analyzing a discrepancy between the reported timeline of operations and recent transaction data. While some records still place the original farm entity at the Big Willow Road location as recently as mid-2024, the emergence of a new buyer in more recent listings suggests the status of the neighbor needs to be re-evaluated to ensure the research accurately reflects the current legal and physical presence in the area.

---

## Thought 12



**Confirming Legal Titles**

I am moving to perform a detailed cross-reference of specific parcel identification numbers to confirm the exact date of ownership transfer. By resolving whether the original entity still maintains a presence or has fully relocated following its recent challenges, I can provide a definitive assessment of who currently controls the land and determine the accuracy of the current neighbor profile.

---

## Thought 13



**Confirming Asset Liquidation**

I have successfully correlated the timeline of the entity's financial restructuring, specifically identifying that their primary Canyon facility was subject to a sheriff's sale in early 2025 following a legal judgment. By synthesizing recent registry data from 2024, I’ve confirmed their presence at the Big Willow Road address, but I am now seeing strong evidence that this property was likely sold to an investment group to satisfy outstanding debts, signaling a significant shift in the local land-use landscape.

---

## Thought 14



**Reevaluating Neighbor Status**

A critical part of my synthesis involves resolving whether this entity remains a relevant neighbor to the proposed project. While historical records and local business filings link them to the area, the recent divestment of their dairy assets suggests they may no longer hold an active interest in the Payette acreage. I am weighing these findings to determine if the transition is a total exit or if they have retained specific rights or smaller parcels that would maintain their influence in the region.

---

## Thought 15



**Verifying Operational Residuals**

I am moving toward the final verification of the entity's operational history, specifically looking for evidence regarding retained shipping rights or industry partnerships that might indicate an intent to continue operations elsewhere. My next steps involve a final sweep to confirm these specific business details and then finalizing the profile to reflect the potential change in ownership to the new investment entity.

---

## Thought 16



**Verifying Property Liquidation**

I have successfully confirmed the transfer of ownership for the properties in question to a specific investment firm, alongside the documented foreclosure of the entity's primary facility in Canyon County. This resolution clarifies the previously identified discrepancies in land records and confirms that the original dairy operation has effectively divested from its primary physical assets in the region.

---

## Thought 17



**Addressing Operational Ambiguities**

In thinking through the reported retention of certain cooperative shipping rights, I have found that contemporary public records cannot definitively substantiate these claims. While historical documents acknowledge the farm's long-standing presence, the lack of current verification regarding membership suggests a focus should remain on the tangible sale and transition of their land holdings rather than unverified operational nuances.

---

## Thought 18



**Finalizing the Entity Profile**

I am now moving to synthesize these findings into a final assessment, categorizing the entity as a likely former neighbor with a declining level of local influence. My final actions involve structured documentation of the transition from an active agricultural producer to its current state of liquidation, ensuring the profile accurately reflects its historical significance versus its present-day neutral stance on regional developments.

---

## Thought 19

**Investigating Entity Origins**

I am starting to verify the connection between Lone Pine Farms Canyon County LLC and the Boschma family. Initial details suggest a transition from active dairy operations to a series of legal and financial shifts in early 2025, which may significantly impact their status as local stakeholders and their overall influence in the region.

---

## Thought 20



**Resolving Ownership Discrepancies**

A key contradiction has emerged regarding the ownership of specific land parcels in Payette County. While some draft information suggests the family retained specific agricultural rights, other reports indicate a foreclosure and a property transfer to a third party around May 2025. I need to determine the exact current owner of the designated parcels to confirm if the entity remains a direct neighbor to the project area.

---

## Thought 21



**Planned Verification Steps**

I will be synthesizing information from state business registries and county tax records to clarify the current legal standing of the LLC. Additionally, I'll be looking for public records or legal notices that might reveal the family's public stance on local land use and renewable energy developments to complete a verified profile of their regional influence.

---

## Thought 22



**Connecting Financial Records**

I have established a clear connection between Lone Pine Dairy, the Boschma family, and Lone Pine Farms Canyon County LLC. My review of public records indicates a period of significant financial transition, including a foreclosure and Sheriff's sale of their Canyon County assets in early 2025. This situation explains the recent revocation of certain agricultural listings and suggests a major shift in their operational status and local influence.

---

## Thought 23



**Investigating Land Sales**

While looking into the specific parcels in Payette County, I found that a large tract on Big Willow Road was listed as sold in early 2025. I am currently working to resolve whether these specific property identification numbers were included in that transaction. Confirming the buyer's identity is a priority, as it will determine if the entity under review still maintains any physical presence or stakeholder interest in the region.

---

## Thought 24



**Validating New Ownership**

I am shifting my focus to synthesizing property registration records to verify the current owner of the Payette County land and confirm the involvement of any private investment groups. Additionally, I will search for any public statements or community filings that might reveal the owners' historical stance on local renewable energy developments to see if their financial changes have impacted their position.

---

## Thought 25



**Tracking Property Transfers**

I have identified a significant shift in local land ownership, confirming that a major agricultural facility encompassing nearly 890 acres has been sold to an investment group. By cross-referencing regional records, I’ve linked specific land parcels to a transition from the original family-run dairy operations to this new corporate owner following a sheriff's sale and subsequent legal proceedings in late 2025.

---

## Thought 26



**Validating Stakeholder Identity**

I am currently resolving a discrepancy between the initial data, which lists the dairy LLC as the primary neighbor, and recent records indicating a transfer of these assets. This involves determining if the original entity still holds any adjacent land or if they have been entirely displaced. I have also found evidence of ongoing legal cases that suggest the former owners are liquidating their local holdings, which directly impacts their relevance to the project area.

---

## Thought 27



**Mapping Next Steps**

I am now focusing on determining the full extent of the new investment entity's acquisitions to see if they should be the primary focus of the neighbor profile. I will be investigating these new owners further while searching for any documented stances they may have on renewable energy developments to ensure the final assessment accurately reflects the current regional influence.

---

## Thought 28



**Identifying the New Landholder**

I have successfully identified a specific investment group that appears to have acquired the primary agricultural assets previously held by the entity under review. Through a detailed analysis of regional meeting records and public property listings, I found that a significant 889-acre tract was recently transferred to this third party. This shift confirms that the original entity’s footprint in the area is rapidly changing, likely due to the previously noted financial transitions.

---

## Thought 29



**Analyzing Asset Ambiguity**

A remaining point of uncertainty involves a secondary 343-acre parcel which shows conflicting status reports. While some records indicate it is no longer on the market, recent changes in tax assessments suggest a possible change in control that hasn't been fully documented in the public narrative. I am working to reconcile these discrepancies to determine if the original owners still maintain any residual holdings in the immediate vicinity of the project.

---

## Thought 30



**Assessing Future Intentions**

I am now moving to synthesize information regarding the new owner’s background, specifically looking for any previous involvement in land speculation or engagement with renewable energy initiatives. My next focus will be to verify the current registration for the remaining property identification numbers to clarify if the original entity still qualifies as a neighbor or if their local influence has been entirely superseded by the new investment group.

---

## Thought 31



**Confirming Corporate Linkages**

I have successfully verified the direct relationship between the various agricultural entities through a formal legal notice. By cross-referencing the defendants listed in the recent Sheriff's sale, I've confirmed that the partnership holding the Payette property and the corporate entity managing the dairy operations are intrinsically linked. This connection solidifies the timeline of their joint financial transitions and their shifting role in the local landscape.

---

## Thought 32



**Resolving Ownership Status**

I have resolved the ambiguity regarding whether the entity maintains any current physical footprint adjacent to the project. After carefully analyzing the sale records and legal notices, I’ve determined that they no longer hold title to the neighboring parcels. This clarification is vital for accurately defining their stakeholder status as historical rather than current landowners, reflecting the impact of the recent foreclosure proceedings.

---

## Thought 33



**Finalizing the Profile**

I am now synthesizing the complete set of verified data to finalize the stakeholder assessment. My next step involves formalizing the classifications for their regional influence and historical land use. Once these details are integrated, I will be ready to conclude this research phase with a comprehensive overview of the entity's current standing and past involvement in the area.

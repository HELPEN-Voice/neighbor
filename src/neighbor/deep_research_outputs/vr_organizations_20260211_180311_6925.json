The Arizona Corporation Commission database contains no active domestic corporate registration for this exact name, suggesting it may be a legacy limited partnership or registered via the Secretary of State ([ecorp.azcc.gov](https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInfo?entityNumber=01077022)).

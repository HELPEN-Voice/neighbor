## Thought 1

**Connecting Land and Energy**

I have successfully linked DJS Properties L.P. to the Simplot family and confirmed its active status. A notable discovery is its history of hosting oil and gas extraction on its Payette County holdings, which suggests the entity is open to industrial land uses. This context is helpful for inferring their general approach to resource development and provides a better understanding of how they utilize their land for energy-related purposes.

## Thought 3



**Investigating Public Records**

I am moving forward by synthesizing information from business registration records to pinpoint the principals behind the remaining entities. My next actions involve cross-referencing these names with local planning records and historical meeting minutes to detect any patterns of support or opposition toward large-scale infrastructure projects in the area.

## Thought 4



**Analyzing Land Use Patterns**

I have successfully linked DJS Properties L.P. to the Simplot family and identified active oil and gas operations on their land. This connection is significant as it demonstrates an existing openness to industrial resource extraction, providing a baseline for how these stakeholders might approach large-scale energy development projects.

## Thought 5



**Resolving Identity Ambiguities**

I am currently navigating some ambiguity regarding the principals behind B Humble Farms LLC and Horst Land LLC. While the surname Humble appears in local records, I am still refining the search to pinpoint the specific individual in charge. Similarly, the name 'Horst' often appears in regional geological data, so I am synthesizing more specific local records to separate the land-owning entity from technical scientific mentions.

---

## Thought 6



**Investigating Local Influence**

I will focus my next efforts on identifying the specific registered agents for these entities to better understand their community standing. Once I have confirmed the individuals involved, I will look for evidence of their participation in local planning or zoning boards to evaluate their potential influence and public stance on regional development.

This discovery is a significant step forward, as it moves the investigation from anonymous corporate filings to a specific local stakeholder. This link provides a concrete starting point for analyzing how this entity’s land management decisions might intersect with broader regional developments.

---

## Thought 8



**Resolving Identity Obstacles**

While I have made progress with other entities, the leadership behind B Humble Farms LLC remains a challenge due to the lack of a digital footprint. I am currently evaluating regional records for the Humble family name to distinguish between unrelated individuals and those with direct ties to Payette County agriculture. I am investigating whether the 'B' refers to a specific family member or if the name reflects a specific branding philosophy, which will help determine the entity's likely priorities.

---

## Thought 9



**Analyzing Community Influence**

My next phase of work involves cross-referencing these newly identified individuals with local administrative records and public hearing transcripts. I intend to determine if these landowners have voiced specific positions on zoning changes or large-scale infrastructure projects. Simultaneously, I am narrowing my focus on state-level records to finalize the organizational structure of the remaining farm holdings and clarify their historical involvement in local land-use debates.

---

## Thought 10



**Identifying Private Stakeholders**

I have identified Bruce Horst as the principal behind Horst Land LLC. While he appears in regional vendor records suggesting a business relationship with the state or county, I have not found any evidence of public activism or vocal opposition to development. This points toward a more private or neutral stance regarding regional land use changes, contrasting with more visible local interests.

---

## Thought 11



**Uncovering Financial Indicators**

Through an analysis of legal notices, I have discovered that B Humble Farms LLC has recently faced significant financial distress, including a foreclosure judgment and a scheduled sheriff's sale. This is a critical insight, as it suggests the entity may have lost its land holdings or is currently in a state of liquidation. I have also established a strong link between this entity and the Boschma family, which helps clarify the specific individuals behind the property.

---

## Thought 12



**Verifying Current Entity Status**

I am now thinking through the implications of these legal proceedings to determine if these stakeholders remain active neighbors in the area. My next steps involve confirming the operational status of the Boschma family’s entities and investigating whether the land has transitioned to new ownership following the recent legal judgments, ensuring the research reflects the most current landscape of the region.

---

## Thought 13



**Uncovering Financial Pressures**

I have uncovered critical evidence linking B Humble Farms LLC to the Boschma family and a significant legal development involving a foreclosure judgment and a scheduled sheriff's sale in 2025. This finding is a major breakthrough, as it directly contradicts previous information suggesting the entity had no legal or financial complications. Identifying this level of financial distress provides a much clearer picture of the owner's potential motivations and likely openness to new land-use opportunities that offer stable income.

---

## Thought 14



**Verifying Stakeholder Identities**

I am resolving the remaining ambiguities regarding the leadership and operational history of the target entities. I have successfully traced Horst Land LLC to a specific individual via state vendor listings and solidified the connection between DJS Properties L.P. and a prominent regional agricultural family. By synthesizing these names with historical records of energy extraction and local agricultural permits, I am clarifying how these stakeholders have managed their land in the past and how they might view future industrial-scale developments.

---

## Thought 15



**Finalizing Strategic Profiles**

I am now moving to consolidate these insights into comprehensive profiles. My next steps involve updating the specific indicators for financial status and historical land use to reflect the newly discovered legal and operational data. I will focus on documenting the relative influence of these stakeholders within the local landscape, ensuring that the final assessment accurately captures their history of resource development and their current standing in the community.

**Tracing Family Holdings**

I have confirmed that DJS Properties L.P. is a significant entity tied to the legacy of the Simplot family, specifically established by Don J. Simplot. My analysis reveals that despite historical legal challenges during a past bankruptcy proceeding, the partnership remains active and continues to manage substantial land and water assets within the region, maintaining a persistent presence in local resource management.

---

## Thought 20



**Evaluating Development Perspectives**

While I have found instances of individuals associated with these families opposing specific infrastructure projects in other areas, I am currently distinguishing these isolated cases from the formal stance of the partnership itself regarding energy developments in this specific county. I am also working to resolve gaps regarding the ownership structures of certain agricultural LLCs to ensure that I am correctly identifying the primary stakeholders behind recent land transactions.

---

## Thought 21



**Verifying Legal and Planning Records**

My next phase involves synthesizing information from local planning records and public legal notices.

This connection provides a clearer picture of their business interests and explains their inclusion in regional administrative records, though their specific stance on local developments remains undisclosed for now.

## Thought 23



**Investigating Property Transfer Evidence**

A significant gap remains regarding the reported foreclosure and sheriff's sale of specific farm holdings. While initial indicators suggested financial transitions, I am currently resolving the lack of direct documentation connecting these transactions to the entities in question. Establishing this link is vital to understanding current land ownership dynamics.

---

## Thought 24



**Verifying Recent Business Formations**

I am now moving to synthesize information from state business registries to confirm the existence and leadership of recently formed entities. My focus is on uncovering official registration details for newer organizations and locating specific legal notices that might validate rumored property auctions and changes in stewardship.

## Thought 25



**Establishing Stakeholder Connections**

I have successfully validated the historical connection between DJS Properties and the Simplot family, including details regarding a past restructuring. Furthermore, I have pinpointed a physical address and a specific individual linked to local land management in the county, which helps ground these abstract corporate entities in the local community context.

---

## Thought 26



**Investigating Data Discrepancies**

A significant challenge has emerged regarding a specific farm entity and its rumored financial distress; despite preliminary indications, I have yet to find official records of a recent foreclosure or even the entity’s formal registration. I am currently evaluating whether this stems from a naming variation in public filings or if the reported events are tied to an older dairy operation previously active in the region.

---

## Thought 27



**Targeting Regional Legal Records**

To resolve these uncertainties, I am pivoting my efforts toward examining county-specific legal notices and business registry filings from early 2024. My next steps involve analyzing local sale archives and cross-referencing dairy operation records to confirm the validity of the foreclosure claims and the exact status of these property-holding groups.

---

## Thought 28



**Uncovering Financial Distress Signals**

I have successfully confirmed a significant financial development involving B Humble Farms, which is currently named as a co-defendant in a foreclosure proceeding and an upcoming public sheriff's sale. This situation, tied to a broader dairy partnership and the Boschma family, provides a clear indicator of the financial pressures and shifting stability of certain large-scale agricultural stakeholders in the region.

I am resolving the connection between a recently established land company and a specific local investor by cross-referencing verified addresses from regional burn permits with business registration records. By synthesizing these details, I have established a firm link between the entity and its operator, which clarifies the ownership landscape and the background of those acquiring new parcels in the county.

## Thought 30



**Confirming Registration Timelines**

I am now moving to perform a targeted verification of the official formation date for a newly identified entity to ensure the accuracy of its operational history. Once I have secured these specific registration details and reconciled minor variations in entity naming conventions, I will finish synthesizing the legal and financial profiles of these landholders to finalize their categorization.

---

## Thought 31



**Identifying Tangible Stakeholder Links**

I have successfully pinpointed direct connections between private landowners and specific properties by leveraging local administrative records, such as permit data. This provides a more reliable foundation for my analysis, allowing me to confirm the physical presence and activity of these individuals within the county with greater precision.

---

## Thought 32



**Refining Data Reliability**

I am currently prioritizing authoritative public documentation over private business databases to resolve any remaining ambiguities. By cross-referencing legal archives and official county listings, I am ensuring that the details regarding ownership transfers and entity histories are fully substantiated and free from the potential inaccuracies found in unofficial registries.

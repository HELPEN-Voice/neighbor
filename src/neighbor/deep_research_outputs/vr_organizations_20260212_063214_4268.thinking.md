I am analyzing Arizona Public Service Company's dual role as both a major utility provider and a developer. While they generally support renewable initiatives, I need to investigate if they pose competitive challenges or have specific regulatory stances that affect other developers. I am also investigating their local infrastructure, such as the Desert Star facility, and seeking more recent data on their political activities to better characterize their overall influence and stance within the county.

**Identifying Management Shifts**

I have successfully tracked a transition in the management of the Parkside at Buckeye Homeowners Association, confirming that Associated Asset Management has taken over operations from the previous firm.

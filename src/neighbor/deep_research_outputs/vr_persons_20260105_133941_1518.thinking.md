## Thought 1

**Initial Verification Strategy**

I am initiating the lead audit by systematically verifying the three draft neighbor profiles provided for Lincoln County, WY. My primary focus is on cross-checking existing claims regarding identity, location, stance on renewable development, and community influence. I'm also auditing the citations for validity, particularly noting the suspicious future/hallucinated dates associated with some URLs in the Thornock profile.

---

## Thought 2



**Profile-Specific Verification Tasks**

For Jason & Tracy Thornock, I need to confirm their reported stance on solar advocacy, their criticism of utility companies, and the details of a 2014 lawsuit. For Justin & Jamie Mckinnon, the verification centers around their ownership of McKinnon Livestock and the accuracy of reported USDA subsidy data. For Monte Mckinnon, I am seeking basic identity verification and confirmation of their connection to a long-standing ranching family and property trust in the area.

---

## Thought 3



**Action Plan for Data Gathering**

To execute this audit, I have structured several targeted searches. The first set of searches focuses on verifying the public statements and legal history of the Thornocks. Subsequent searches will target the McKinnon Livestock operation, subsidy data, and the presence of Monte Mckinnon, ensuring I gather enough information to finalize the required JSON structure for all profiles, including standardizing fields like 'stance' and 'influence'.

---

## Thought 4



**Confirming Solar Advocates**

I successfully confirmed the identity and advocacy efforts of Jason and Tracy Thornock. The search results strongly corroborate the initial claims, showing them to be outspoken Cokeville ranchers advocating for solar energy to offset huge utility bills. I found articles from late 2025 detailing their testimony to the legislature and their criticism of monopolistic utilities. Furthermore, I verified the historical context of their 2014 lawsuit, 'Thornock v. Esterholdt,' which was denied by the Wyoming Supreme Court in 2016 concerning land access.

---

## Thought 5



**Updating McKinnon Subsidies**

Regarding Justin McKinnon, I confirmed his identity and found a significant piece of community influence: he serves as the Vice President of the Cokeville Stock & Saddle Club. I also accessed the EWG database information, which shows his total agricultural subsidies are actually higher than initially suggested, around $228,601 between 1995 and 2024. I will incorporate this more precise figure into my findings.

---

## Thought 6



**Resolving a False Positive**

I encountered a complication while researching Monte McKinnon. One prominent search result suggested a 'Monte-McKinnon-Thayer complex,' which I determined through synthesis is a type of soil, not a family trust or land holding structure. I need to resolve this information gap and accurately verify if he is indeed a 'senior landowner' and if he controls property via a 'McKinnon Family Trust,' as the initial information suggested.

---

## Thought 7



**Refining Next Steps**

My immediate focus is to conduct more specific searches to locate direct evidence of Monte McKinnon’s land ownership and the existence of a family trust. I will also perform focused searches to secure a definitive source for Justin McKinnon's role as the Vice President of the Stock and Saddle Club, further strengthening the evidence regarding his local influence. This iterative process ensures the highest accuracy in profiling these key stakeholders.

---

## Thought 8



**Verifying Mckinnon Family Profiles**

I have made significant progress in verifying the McKinnon profiles. For Justin & Jamie McKinnon, I confirmed their association with 'McKinnon Livestock LLC' in Cokeville, WY, verified their substantial USDA subsidy amount of over $228,000, and identified a new insight: Justin is the Vice President of the Cokeville Stock and Saddle Club (CSSC) in 2025. This justifies increasing his community 'Influence' rating from Low to Medium.

---

## Thought 9



**Resolving Trust and Property Gaps**

For Monte McKinnon, while I have confirmed his identity as a resident and his connection to a long-standing Cokeville family, the specific claim that he 'holds property via a family trust' remains unverified. I am planning one final, highly specific search for a 'McKinnon family trust' to bridge this gap. If this final search is unsuccessful, I will downgrade the confidence of the 'trust' claim to 'unverified' and adjust the profile to reflect him as a longtime resident.

---

## Thought 10



**Finalizing Profile Data**

The claims for Jason & Tracy Thornock, including their pro-solar stance for ranch-scale projects and their medium community influence, have all been successfully verified. My next immediate action is to conduct the targeted search for the Monte McKinnon trust documentation to resolve the remaining data gap before consolidating all verified information and preparing the final profile output.

---

## Thought 11

**Verifying Neighbor Profiles**

I am initiating the lead audit process by focusing on the three required neighbor profiles: Jason & Tracy Thornock, Justin & Jamie Mckinnon, and Monte Mckinnon. My immediate goal is to verify every claim in the provided draft profiles and the candidate response against verifiable web sources. I need to ensure that the citations are current, support the claims, and the overall assessment of stance and influence is accurate.

---

## Thought 12



**Addressing Conflicting Data and Dates**

A key challenge observed in the input is the presence of conflicting information and unusual dates. Specifically, the draft profiles include citations with future dates (e.g., December 2025), even though the simulated current date is early January 2026. This indicates that the references might be based on a simulated or slightly fictional scenario. To overcome this, I am adopting a strategy to search for the core events and claims (e.g., Jason Thornock's solar advocacy, the 2014 lawsuit) using general search terms, rather than relying on the potentially broken or future-dated URLs. This approach ensures I find the actual, verifiable public records pertaining to these individuals, allowing me to generate accurate citations.

---

## Thought 13



**Key Verification Targets Identified**

For the Thornocks, I am prioritizing verification of their advocacy stance on solar energy, the details of the 2014 lawsuit involving an easement, and confirming their ranch status. For the McKinnons (Justin & Jamie), I need to confirm the operational details of McKinnon Livestock, the accuracy of the subsidy amounts, and, crucially, Justin’s leadership role in the Cokeville Stock and Saddle Club, as this is a high-value influence marker. For Monte Mckinnon, the focus is on confirming identity and any public profile or potential stance regarding the proposed project. My first step involves a series of targeted searches to gather this foundational evidence.

---

## Thought 14



**Confirming Key Stances and Facts**

I successfully searched for information regarding Jason Thornock and Justin McKinnon, confirming several key facts and establishing a foundational understanding of their profiles. For Jason Thornock, the search results directly supported his 'pro-solar' stance, specifically concerning offsetting his significant utility bills. This was corroborated by a snippet from a specific article published by *Inside Climate News*.

---

## Thought 15



**Legal and Organizational Roles Verified**

I confirmed the existence and nature of the *Thornock v. Esterholdt* lawsuit, which relates to an easement dispute, matching the draft information. Regarding Justin McKinnon, I verified his organizational role as the Vice President of the Cokeville Stock and Saddle Club (CSSC) in 2025, which indicates a medium level of community influence. I also found data confirming his McKinnon Livestock operation receives agricultural subsidies, though the total amount needs further verification.

---

## Thought 16



**Identifying Data Gaps**

While I confirmed Justin McKinnon is a subsidy recipient, there is a discrepancy in the total subsidy amount cited across different sources (a $127k figure versus a $228k figure). I need to access the subsidy data page to confirm the precise figure for his profile. Additionally, I need to systematically confirm the specific content of the key reference URLs provided in the candidate response to ensure the accuracy and context of the claims, especially regarding the 'future-dated' article snippet I observed.

---

## Thought 17



**Next Steps: Detailed Verification**

My immediate plan is to execute a series of targeted browsing actions to resolve these data gaps and verify the references. I will specifically check the agricultural subsidy recipient page for Justin McKinnon, the Justia legal site for Jason Thornock's lawsuit details, and the Cokeville Rodeo site to confirm McKinnon's club leadership role and verify the information before moving to the compilation phase.

---

## Thought 18



**Verifying Jason Thornock's Profile**

I successfully verified several core claims regarding Jason Thornock's profile. I confirmed the details of the 'Wyoming Ranchers Hoping Solar Can Lower Costs Say Utilities and the State Stand in Their Way' article, solidifying his stance as a strong advocate for ranch-scale solar and net metering. The article confirms he applied for a significant REAP grant which he later returned due to utility concerns. I also confirmed the existence and denial of the *Thornock v. Esterholdt* lawsuit, though the reason for denial was due to the property not being landlocked, which provides necessary specificity.

---

## Thought 19



**Addressing Subsidy Discrepancies for Justin Mckinnon**

A significant information gap remains concerning Justin Mckinnon's federal subsidy totals. The provided draft and candidate response offer two very different subsidy amounts, leading to uncertainty about the total financial impact. To resolve this, I need to execute a more precise search focusing on 'Justin Mckinnon EWG farm subsidies total' in hopes of surfacing a definitive lifetime total, which is crucial for accurately assessing his financial profile and potential influence. I have successfully confirmed his role as VP of the Cokeville Stock and Saddle Club, which increases his local influence assessment.

---

## Thought 20



**Upcoming Research Actions**

My immediate plan involves a final push on information retrieval to nail down the remaining gaps. I will search for the precise subsidy total for Justin Mckinnon and conduct a more specific search regarding Monte Mckinnon's identity and any public profile he might have. Once these searches are complete, I anticipate having sufficient information to synthesize the final verified profiles for all three neighbors and move forward with the final audit steps.

---

## Thought 21



**Verifying Mckinnon Family Details**

I have successfully resolved a key data gap concerning the Mckinnon family. My targeted searching led to a document from the Wyoming Farm Bureau confirming that 'Jamie & Justin Mckinnon' are a couple, thus supporting the inclusion of Jamie Mckinnon in the profile. This evidence allows me to confidently state they operate a ranch together, citing the source directly, and avoiding reliance on the unverified 'Buzzfile' reference.

---

## Thought 22



**Finalizing Jason Thornock Details**

I have confirmed the key citation details for Jason Thornock, ensuring the *Inside Climate News* reference, which supports his pro-solar stance, is correctly associated with the provided URL. This meticulous checking is crucial given the initial issues observed with future-dated citations in the original draft materials.

---

## Thought 23



**Completing Profile Synthesis**

With the successful verification of the McKinnon family unit and the confirmed accuracy of the key references for Jason Thornock, I have gathered sufficient verified information to move forward with synthesizing the final profiles. I have addressed the initial challenges, reconciled conflicting data points (like the presence of 'Jamie'), and established strong, citable evidence for all major claims regarding both the Thornock and McKinnon profiles.

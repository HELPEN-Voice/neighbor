I’ve identified a potential timeline for Norma Braden’s recent passing, which aligns with her husband’s earlier records, but I still need to verify the specific details of her legacy.

**Confirming Community Legacies**

I have successfully confirmed that the family recently transitioned a major land asset, known as the Braden Farm, to the regional development authority for industrial expansion.

**Reconciling Property Records**

I am currently resolving a conflict between public land surveys and my existing information concerning the specific owner of a parcel on Cartersville Highway.

## Thought 12



**Finalizing Ownership Structures**

I am moving toward a targeted examination of county assessor records to verify the exact boundaries and ownership of the remaining family parcels.

## Thought 15



**Synthesizing Definitive Stances**

I am concluding the research by integrating the details of the significant farm sale near US 411 East with the family’s long-term involvement in regional planning. I will now finalize my analysis and ensure that the documented evidence—from federal subsidy records to local property transfers—fully supports the identified stances on industrial expansion.

---

## Thought 16

**Mapping Family and Business Ties**

I am examining the connections between the local partnership and the individual residents in Floyd County to establish a clear network of influence. I've identified that one individual recently passed away in early 2026, so I am prioritizing the verification of obituary records to capture their historical involvement in community organizations, such as local garden clubs and church groups, which often signals a resident's level of local impact.

---

## Thought 17



**Evaluating Development Stance**

A significant point of my investigation involves a 202-acre land transaction with a development authority back in 2021. I am synthesizing how this past sale might reflect the current stance toward new energy projects in the region.

## Thought 19



**Deepening Local Context**

I have confirmed the passing of Norma S. Braden and her extensive leadership in various local civic and gardening clubs, which establishes her as a significant figure in the community. Furthermore, I’ve identified a strong historical link between the family and industrial growth through the late Biddy Hill Braden, who held a position on the Rome-Floyd County Industrial Development Commission. This background provides a clear rationale for the family's long-standing influence and their likely familiarity with regional development initiatives.

---

## Thought 20



**Reconciling Transaction Details**

While the family's historical importance is clear, I am currently working to resolve specific details regarding a reported sale of over 200 acres intended for an industrial development corridor. I am specifically looking for definitive evidence that links this transaction to the family's current stance on regional expansion. Additionally, I need to clarify the exact status of the family’s limited partnership to ensure that my assessment of their modern-day influence and land holdings is accurate.

This allows for a more granular understanding of how these entities influenced local land use.

**Constructing Final Verified Assessments**

I am now integrating these verified details into a final comprehensive evaluation.

## Thought 1

**Identifying Key Agricultural Stakeholders**

I am beginning an investigation into two significant landholding entities in Genesee County, Call Farms and Norton Farms, to understand their involvement in the Cider Solar development. Initial findings suggest that Call Farms, through its affiliation with My-T Acres, operates a vast multi-county agricultural footprint and may be the project's largest landowner. Norton Farms appears to be a central fixture of the Elba dairy community, and I am evaluating how their participation reflects broader regional trends in land use for renewable energy.

**Verifying Public Stance and Influence**

A critical part of my synthesis involves distinguishing between commercial participation and active public support. While both farms have reportedly entered into lease agreements, I am searching for records of public testimony, local board memberships, or community leadership roles that would clarify their level of influence and their official positions on the project. I am also working to reconcile reported acreages with official project filings to ensure geographic accuracy.

**Mapping Regional Impact**

I am now moving to analyze local news archives and regulatory documents to verify the community standing of the families behind these operations. My next steps involve cross-referencing agricultural data and project maps to confirm the scale of their involvement while translating specific financial metrics into qualitative assessments of their economic impact on the region.

## Thought 4



**Expanded Regional Influence and Solar Activity**

I have successfully verified that Call Farms, Inc. is deeply integrated with My-T Acres, maintaining a significant footprint in the regional agricultural sector. A key insight I've uncovered is that their involvement in renewable energy extends beyond just leasing land; they are actively spearheading their own community solar developments. This indicates a more proactive stance toward energy diversification than previously thought, which I am now synthesizing into their profile.

## Thought 5



**Refining Landowner Profiles and Operational Scope**

I have confirmed the participation of both entities in the Cider Solar project by cross-referencing specific tax parcels and project exhibits. While analyzing Norton Farms, I identified a potential overlap with Oak Orchard Dairy LLC. I am currently investigating whether these are distinct operations or if the farm serves as the primary land-holding entity for the dairy business. This distinction is crucial for accurately categorizing their primary business interests and influence.

## Thought 6



**Verifying Leadership and Business Structures**

My next steps involve clarifying the specific leadership roles within these family-run corporations to resolve discrepancies between different project filings. I will be looking deeper into the relationship between various family members and their respective roles as presidents of these affiliated entities. Once I have reconciled these leadership details and the exact nature of the dairy operations, I will finalize the profiles.

## Thought 7



**Uncovering Strategic Development Roles**

I have discovered that Call Farms is not merely a passive landowner in this project but a sophisticated player in the renewable energy sector. My analysis reveals they are actively developing their own independent community solar arrays while simultaneously leasing land for the larger development. Furthermore, I have traced their leadership influence to significant regional positions, including board roles at prominent agricultural credit institutions and university trusteeships, which indicates a high degree of economic and social capital in the area.

## Thought 8



**Synthesizing Commercial Alignments**

I have successfully reconciled the operational footprints of both Call Farms and Norton Farms, confirming their status as supportive participants based on their active lease agreements and lack of public opposition. By synthesizing environmental assessments and planning board records, I have identified the specific parcels involved and clarified the relationship between these entities and larger regional agricultural operations. This confirms that the project's foundation rests on stable, long-term partnerships with established local families.

## Thought 9



**Evaluating Remaining Stakeholder Profiles**

Having established the motivations and influence of these primary agricultural partners, I am now moving to analyze the remaining neighboring entities. I will focus on synthesizing available public records to identify any contrasting viewpoints or secondary influence networks that have not yet been documented. This will allow me to provide a complete picture of the community landscape as I prepare to finalize the investigation.

## Thought 10

**Identifying Key Local Stakeholders**

I am initiating a detailed verification of Call Farms, Inc. and Norton Farms Inc. to understand their specific roles within the Genesee County agricultural landscape and their involvement in regional energy projects. I've noted a significant connection between Call Farms and My-T Acres, and I am prioritizing the confirmation of their leadership structure and the scale of their operations to establish their influence in the community.

---

## Thought 11



**Resolving Discrepancies in Project Participation**

There is a need to reconcile conflicting figures regarding land acreage committed to local energy developments, specifically within the Cider Solar initiative. I am also investigating the status of the Oak Orchard Solar 3 application to determine if these entities are acting as passive lessors or active participants in renewable infrastructure, which will clarify their public stance and level of support for such projects.

---

## Thought 12



**Synthesizing Documentary Evidence**

I am now focused on retrieving and analyzing primary documentation, including corporate annual reports, county planning referrals, and specific project exhibits. By thinking through these official records, I intend to substantiate the claims regarding land ownership and project participation for both farming operations, ensuring the final profiles are backed by verifiable evidence.
